\section{Future Work}
Use SPM segment with the FLAIR + T1 to obtain nice GM/WM segmentation. This allows:
- mixture-model-based standardization of graylevels, since now more accurate?
- estimated GM to clean up false positives

deep learning advantages:
- context-aware
- no graylevel standardization necessary
