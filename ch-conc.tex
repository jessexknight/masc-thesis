\section{Future Work}
%Use SPM segment with the FLAIR + T1 to obtain nice GM/WM segmentation. This allows:
%- mixture-model-based standardization of graylevels, since now more accurate?
%- estimated GM to clean up false positives
%
%deep learning advantages:
%- context-aware
%- minimal graylevel standardization necessary
% 
%Graylevel standardization still the key to victory, I think -- need justification of this
%improved registration may also be helpful, since \cite{Klein2009} note that SPM is not the best (time constraints)

\subsection{Integrative Models}
%There are several advantages to the unified models in the SPM and FSL Segment tools.
%In fact, early ambitions for the current work included integrating
%the WMH segmentation model within SPM Segment.
% advantages:
% - better estimation of bias field
% - more robust registration at low voxel resolution.
% - don't include WMH in estimated healthy tissue classes
% why not:
% - time constraints...
% - prelim investigations: using estimated WM / GM distributions for standardization didn't work.
