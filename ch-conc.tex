\section{Future Work}
%Use SPM segment with the FLAIR + T1 to obtain nice GM/WM segmentation. This allows:
%- mixture-model-based standardization of graylevels, since now more accurate?
%- estimated GM to clean up false positives
%
%deep learning advantages:
%- context-aware
%- minimal graylevel standardization necessary
% 
%Graylevel standardization still the key to victory, I think -- need justification of this
%improved registration may also be helpful, since \cite{Klein2009} note that SPM is not the best (time constraints)
