abstract = {In applied statistics regression models with high-dimensional coefficients can occur which cannot be estimated using ordinary computers. Amongst others, this applies to the analysis of digital images taking spatio-temporal dependencies into account as they commonly occur within bio-medical research. In this thesis a procedure is formulated which allows to fit regression models with high-dimensional coefficients and non-normal response values requiring only moderate computational equipment. To this end, limitations of different inference strategies for structured additive regression models are demonstrated when applied to high-dimensional problems and possible solutions are discussed. Based thereon an algorithm is formulated whose strengths and weaknesses are subsequently analyzed using simulation studies. Furthermore, the procedure is applied to three different fields of bio-medical imaging from which can be concluded that the algorithm is a promising candidate for answering high-dimensional problems.},

abstract = {Background and objectives: The last version of the EFNS dementia guidelines is from 2007. In 2010, the revised guidelines for Alzheimer's disease (AD) were published. The current guidelines involve the revision of the dementia syndromes outside of AD, notably vascular cognitive impairment, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, dementia with Lewy bodies, corticobasal syndrome, progressive supranuclear palsy, Parkinson's disease dementia, Huntington's disease, prion diseases, normal-pressure hydrocephalus, limbic encephalitis and other toxic and metabolic disorders. The aim is to present a peer-reviewed evidence-based statement for the guidance of practice for clinical neurologists, geriatricians, psychiatrists and other specialist physicians responsible for the care of patients with dementing disorders. It represents a statement of minimum desirable standards for practice guidance. Methods: The task force working group reviewed evidence from original research articles, meta-analyses and systematic reviews, published by June 2011. The evidence was classified (I, II, III, IV) and consensus recommendations graded (A, B, or C) according to the EFNS guidance. Where there was a lack of evidence, but clear consensus, good practice points were provided. Results and conclusions: New recommendations and good practice points are made for clinical diagnosis, blood tests, neuropsychology, neuroimaging, electroencephalography, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, genetic testing, disclosure of diagnosis, treatment of behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia, legal issues, counselling and support for caregivers. All recommendations were revised as compared with the previous EFNS guidelines. The specialist neurologist together with primary care physicians play an important role in the assessment, interpretation and treatment of symptoms, disability and needs of dementia patients. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s) European Journal of Neurology {\textcopyright} 2012 EFNS.},

abstract = {A novel approach to correcting for intensity nonuniformity in magnetic resonance (MR) data is described that achieves high performance without requiring a model of the tissue classes present. The method has the advantage that it can be applied at an early stage in an automated data analysis, before a tissue model is available. Described as nonparametric nonuniform intensity normalization (N3), the method is independent of pulse sequence and insensitive to pathological data that might otherwise violate model assumptions. To eliminate the dependence of the field estimate on anatomy, an iterative approach is employed to estimate both the multiplicative bias field and the distribution of the true tissue intensities. The performance of this method is evaluated using both real and simulated MR data.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Autopsy studies showed cortical and juxtacortical multiple sclerosis (MS) plaques. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) is an advanced magnetic resonance imaging sequence that reveals tissue T2 prolongation with cerebrospinal fluid suppression, allowing detection of superficial brain lesions. OBJECTIVES: To assess FLAIR, T1-weighted, and T2-weighted images for detecting lesions in or near the cerebral cortex in patients with MS and to explore the relation between cortical lesions and cortical atrophy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Cross-sectional study in a university MS clinic of 84 patients with MS and 66 age-matched healthy controls receiving 1.5-T fast FLAIR, T2-weighted, and T1-weighted images. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Regional cortical atrophy was rated vs controls. Cortical and juxtacortical lesions were ovoid hyperintensities involving the cortex and/or gray-white junction. RESULTS: A total of 810 cortical and juxtacortical lesions were seen by FLAIR in patients (mean, 9.6 per patient), most commonly in the superior frontal lobe. Cortical and juxtacortical lesions were identified in 72 patients and 6 controls. Fourteen percent of cortical and juxtacortical lesions were seen on T1-weighted images and 26{\%} were seen on T2-weighted images. More cortical and juxtacortical lesions were present in secondary progressive disease than relapsing-remitting disease. The total number of cortical and juxtacortical lesions correlated significantly with disease duration and the regional number correlated with the degree of regional atrophy. After taking into account noncortical (white matter) lesions, only the cortical and juxtacortical lesion count predicted atrophy in that region. CONCLUSIONS: FLAIR can detect many cortical and juxtacortical lesions in MS, which were appreciated previously in autopsy studies but usually missed by magnetic resonance imaging during life. Cortical and juxtacortical plaque formation may contribute to cortical atrophy in MS.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between day of admission and measures of the quality and safety of the care received by patients with stroke.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of patients admitted to hospitals with stroke (codes I60-I64 from the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Version) from April 1, 2009, through March 31, 2010.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSETTING: English National Health Service public hospitals.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPATIENTS: PATIENTS during the study period accounted for 93 621 admissions. We used logistic regression to adjust the outcome measures for case mix.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality and safety measurements using 6 indicators spanning the hospital care pathway, from timely brain scans to emergency readmissions after discharge.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Performance across 5 of the 6 measures was significantly lower on weekends (confidence level, 99{\%}). One of the largest disparities was seen in rates of same-day brain scans, which were 43.1{\%} on weekends compared with 47.6{\%} on weekdays (unadjusted odds ratio, 0.83 [95{\%} CI, 0.81-0.86]). In particular, the rate of 7-day in-hospital mortality for Sunday admissions was 11.0{\%} (adjusted odds ratio, 1.26 [95{\%} CI, 1.16-1.37], with Monday used as a reference) compared with a mean of 8.9{\%} for weekday admissions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Strong evidence suggests that, nationally, stroke patients admitted on weekends are less likely to receive urgent treatments and have worse outcomes across a range of indicators. Although we adjusted the results for case mix, we cannot rule out some of the effect being due to unmeasured differences in patients admitted on weekends compared with weekdays. The findings suggest that approximately 350 in-hospital deaths each year within 7 days are potentially avoidable, and an additional 650 people could be discharged to their usual place of residence within 56 days if the performance seen on weekdays was replicated on weekends.},

abstract = {We describe a comprehensive framework for performing rapid and automatic nonlabel-based nonlinear spatial normalizations. The approach adopted minimizes the residual squared difference between an image and a template of the same modality. In order to reduce the number of parameters to be fitted, the nonlinear warps are described by a linear combination of low spatial frequency basis functions. The objective is to determine the optimum coefficients for each of the bases by minimizing the sum of squared differences between the image and template, while simultaneously maximizing the smoothness of the transformation using a maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach. Most MAP approaches assume that the variance associated with each voxel is already known and that there is no covariance between neighboring voxels. The approach described here attempts to estimate this variance from the data, and also corrects for the correlations between neighboring voxels. This makes the same approach suitable for the spatial normalization of both high-quality magnetic resonance images, and low-resolution noisy positron emission tomography images. A fast algorithm has been developed that utilizes Taylor{\&}apos;s theorem and the separable nature of the basis functions, meaning that most of the nonlinear spatial variability between images can be automatically corrected within a few minutes.},

Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of accurate voxel-level estimation of tissue proportions in the human brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Due to the finite resolution of acquisition systems, MRI voxels can contain contributions from more than a single tissue type. The voxel-level estimation of this fractional content is known as partial volume coefficient estimation. In the present work, two new methods to calculate the partial volume coefficients under noisy conditions are introduced and compared with current similar methods. Concretely, a novel Markov Random Field model allowing sharp transitions between partial volume coefficients of neighbouring voxels and an advanced non-local means filtering technique are proposed to reduce the errors due to random noise in the partial volume coefficient estimation. In addition, a comparison was made to find out how the different methodologies affect the measurement of the brain tissue type volumes. Based on the obtained results, the main conclusions are that (1) both Markov Random Field modelling and non-local means filtering improved the partial volume coefficient estimation results, and (2) non-local means filtering was the better of the two strategies for partial volume coefficient estimation.},

abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by the formation of demyelinating lesions in the white matter (WM). However, the timecourse of the evolution of healthy white matter into fully demyelinated lesions in MS is not well understood. We use a recently proposed technique to examine magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) timecourses in lesions segmented from MTR images in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and secondary progressive MS (SPMS). In both groups we found MTR lesions forming both in previously normal appearing WM (de novo lesions) as well as in previously lesional tissue that appears to be experiencing a second round of inflammatory demyelination (repeat lesions). Both de novo and repeat lesions exhibited significant, but incomplete MTR recovery, suggesting partial remyelination; post-lesion MTR values in de novo lesions were similar to pre-lesion values in repeat lesions. Both de novo and repeat lesions were found in subjects in relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive stages of MS, and repeat lesions appeared relatively more common in the secondary progressive phase. These observations support the hypothesis that entirely demyelinated lesions found on histopathology are the result of multiple episodes of demyelination and incomplete remyelination, and may have implications for MS treatment development efforts aimed at neuroprotection and enhancing remyelination. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

Our segmentation method combines information from 3 different MR images: proton density (PD), T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images; our method uses an established artificial intelligent technique (fuzzy inference system) and does not require extensive computations. The reproducibility of the segmentation was evaluated in 9 patients who underwent scan–rescan with repositioning; an inter-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.91 was obtained. The effect of differences in image resolution was tested in 44 patients, scanned with 6- and 3-mm slice thickness FLAIR images; we obtained an ICC value of 0.99. The accuracy of the segmentation was evaluated on 100 patients for whom manual delineation of WMHs was available; the obtained ICC was 0.98 and the similarity index was 0.75. Besides the fact that the approach demonstrated very high volumetric and spatial agreement with expert delineation, the software did not require more than 2 min per patient (from loading the images to saving the results) on a Pentium-4 processor (512 MB RAM).},

abstract = {The main goal of this dissertation is the development and discussion of techniques for higher-level image analysis, i.e., object-level analysis, of breast cancer imagery. Established cytologic (cell) criteria can be contradictory, and even histologic (tissue) criteria (considered the gold standard for diagnosis) are subject to varied interpretation. There is thus a need to quantitatively define characteristics of breast cancer to better coordinate clinical care of women presenting breast masses. We propose here an approach for such quantitative analysis, Quantitative Object- and spatial Arrangement-Level Analysis (QOALA), using expert (pathologist) input to guide the classification process. The main contributions in this work are four-fold. First, we quantitatively analyze the utility of multispectral imagery for classification and segmentation tasks in histopathology imagery. Second, we develop object-level segmentations for several histologic classes, as well as a quantitative object-level segmentation metric. Third, we extract a comprehensive set of both object- and spatial-level features which are used in a feature selection framework for classification of objects and imagery. Fourth, we extend the concepts of object-level features to higher-level image objects, analyze the utility of these high-level objects for image classification, and introduce the concept of a probabilistic graph-based model of imagery. Overall, QOALA yields very good object- and image-level classification performances. More specifically, the object-level features as implemented in QOALA are versatile and general enough to elicit important information from even imperfectly segmented objects. Additionally, the use of non-nuclear features, namely features of cytoplasm and stroma have good classification performance, often exceeding that of nuclei. Higher-level features display a potential to increase both object- and image-level classification performance.},

abstract = {Subject motion during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been problematic since its introduction as a clinical imaging modality. While sensitivity to particle motion or blood flow can be used to provide useful image contrast, bulk motion presents a considerable problem in the majority of clinical applications. It is one of the most frequent sources of artifacts. Over 30 years of research have produced numerous methods to mitigate or correct for motion artifacts, but no single method can be applied in all imaging situations. Instead, a ``toolbox{\{}''{\}} of methods exists, where each tool is suitable for some tasks, but not for others. This article reviews the origins of motion artifacts and presents current mitigation and correction methods. In some imaging situations, the currently available motion correction tools are highly effective; in other cases, appropriate tools still need to be developed. It seems likely that this multifaceted approach will be what eventually solves the motion sensitivity problem in MRI, rather than a single solution that is effective in all situations. This review places a strong emphasis on explaining the physics behind the occurrence of such artifacts, with the aim of aiding artifact detection and mitigation in particular clinical situations.},

abstract = {Cerebral CT perfusion (CTP) imaging is playing an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of acute ischemic strokes. Meanwhile, the reliability of CTP-based ischemic lesion detection has been challenged due to the noisy appearance and low signal-to-noise ratio of CTP maps. To reduce noise and improve image quality, a rigorous study on the noise transfer properties of CTP systems is highly desirable to provide the needed scientific guidance. This paper concerns how noise in the CTP source images propagates to the final CTP maps. Both theoretical deviations and subsequent validation experiments demonstrated that, the noise level of background frames plays a dominant role in the noise of the cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps. This is in direct contradiction with the general belief that noise of non-background image frames is of greater importance in CTP imaging. The study found that when radiation doses delivered to the background frames and to all non-background frames are equal, lowest noise variance is achieved in the final CBV maps. This novel equality condition provides a practical means to optimize radiation dose delivery in CTP data acquisition: radiation exposures should be modulated between background frames and non-background frames so that the above equality condition is satis{\"{i}}nAed. For several typical CTP acquisition protocols, numerical simulations and in vivo canine experiment demonstrated that noise of CBV can be effectively reduced using the proposed exposure modulation method.},

abstract = {This thesis contains the application of the DWT for classification and compression of biomedical images (mammogram, small bowel and retinal). The shift-invariant DWT and several textural descriptors were used to provide scale, translation and semi-rotational (RST) invariant features. The features were classified using LDA with the leave one out method to combat small database sizes. The small bowel images achieved a classification rate of 75{\%} and is the first reported work in the area, the retinal images achieved 81{\%} classification rate and the mammograms achieved a rate of 59{\%}. The success of the system is a due to the RST-invariant features which accounted for various sized masses, different camera angles and textural differences between pathologies. Any failures are a result of overlapping tissues which masked the pathologies. JPEG 2000 was the wavelet-based compressor used and it was compared to JPEG-LS, LJPEG, adaptive Huffman, arithmetic and LZW codes. For 12bpp mammograms, JPEG 2000 offered the best compression (CR of 9.319 and R of 1.288bpp), but suffered from slow compression speeds (501.3 Ksymbols/s). Compression was investigated solely for mammograms since they were the only images stored in raw formats.},

@article{Sormani2013,
abstract = {Background: A meta-analysis of randomised trials in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis published in 2009 showed a quantitative relation between the treatment effects detected on MRI lesions and clinical relapses. We aimed to validate that relation using data from a large and independent set of clinical trials in multiple sclerosis. Methods: We searched Medline for clinical trials that assessed disease-modifying drugs for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis published from Sept 1, 2008, to Oct 31, 2012. We extracted data for the treatment effects on MRI lesions and on relapses from each trial, and the correlation of log transformed relative measures of these treatment effects was assessed with a weighted linear regression analysis. The R2 value was estimated to quantify the strength of the correlation, and we used an interaction test to test for a difference in slope from the previously estimated equation. We also ran several sensitivity analyses. Findings: We identified 31 eligible trials, which provided data for 18 901 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The regression equation derived using data from these studies showed a relation between the concurrent treatment effects on MRI lesions and relapses (slope = 0??52; R2 = 0??71), much the same as was previously estimated (pinteraction = 0??45). Analysis of trials that tested the same drugs in phase 2 and phase 3 studies showed that the effects on MRI lesions over short follow-up periods (6-9 months) can also predict the effects on relapses over longer follow-up periods (12-24 months), with reported effects on relapses that were within the 95{\%} prediction intervals in eight of nine trials. Interpretation: Our findings indicate that the effect of a treatment on relapses can be accurately predicted by the effect of that therapy on MRI lesions, implying that the use of MRI markers as primary endpoints in future clinical trials of treatments for multiple sclerosis can be considered, in specific situations, such as in trials testing generics or biosimilars of drugs with a well known mechanism of action or in paediatric trials testing drugs already approved for adults.

abstract = {The problem of automatic quantification of brain tissue by utilizing single-valued (single echo) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans is addressed. It is shown that this problem can be solved without classification or segmentation, a method that may be particularly useful in quantifying white matter lesions where the range of values associated with the lesions and the white matter may heavily overlap. The general technique utilizes a statistical model of the noise and partial volume effect together with a finite mixture density description of the tissues. The quantification is then formulated as a minimization problem of high order with up to six separate densities as part of the mixture. This problem is solved by tree annealing with and without partial volume utilized, the results compared, and the sensitivity of the tree annealing algorithm to various parameters is exhibited. The actual quantification is performed by two methods: a classification-based method called Bayes quantification, and parameter estimation. Results from each method are presented for synthetic and actual data.},

In this manner, we reduce the problem of image segmentation to that of contour detection.

While impressive achievements have been made in pattern classification problems such as handwritten character recognition, face detection, speaker identification, and prediction of gene function, it is even more exciting that researchers are on the verge of introducing systems that can perform large-scale combinatorial analyses of data, decomposing the data into interacting components. For example, computational methods for automatic scene analysis are now emerging in the computer vision community. These methods decompose an input image into its constituent objects, lighting conditions, motion patterns, etc. Two of the main challenges are finding effective representations and models in specific applications and finding efficient algorithms for inference and learning in these models. In this paper, we advocate the use of graph-based probability models and their associated inference and learning algorithms. We review exact techniques and various approximate, computationally efficient techniques, including iterated conditional modes, the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, Gibbs sampling, the mean field method, variational techniques, structured variational techniques and the sum-product algorithm ("loopy" belief propagation). We describe how each technique can be applied in a vision model of multiple, occluding objects and contrast the behaviors and performances of the techniques using a unifying cost function, free energy.},

abstract = {Very deep convolutional networks have been central to the largest advances in image recognition performance in recent years. One example is the Inception architecture that has been shown to achieve very good performance at relatively low computational cost. Recently, the introduction of residual connections in conjunction with a more traditional architecture has yielded state-of-the-art performance in the 2015 ILSVRC challenge; its performance was similar to the latest generation Inception-v3 network. This raises the question of whether there are any benefit in combining the Inception architecture with residual connections. Here we give clear empirical evidence that training with residual connections accelerates the training of Inception networks significantly. There is also some evidence of residual Inception networks outperforming similarly expensive Inception networks without residual connections by a thin margin. We also present several new streamlined architectures for both residual and non-residual Inception networks. These variations improve the single-frame recognition performance on the ILSVRC 2012 classification task significantly. We further demonstrate how proper activation scaling stabilizes the training of very wide residual Inception networks. With an ensemble of three residual and one Inception-v4, we achieve 3.08 percent top-5 error on the test set of the ImageNet classification (CLS) challenge.},

abstract = {One of the most challenging problems in modern neuroimaging is detailed characterization of neurodegeneration. Quantifying spatial and longitudinal atrophy patterns is an important component of this process. These spatiotemporal signals will aid in discriminating between related diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which manifest themselves in the same at-risk population. Here, we develop a novel symmetric image normalization method (SyN) for maximizing the cross-correlation within the space of diffeomorphic maps and provide the Euler-Lagrange equations necessary for this optimization. We then turn to a careful evaluation of our method. Our evaluation uses gold standard, human cortical segmentation to contrast SyN's performance with a related elastic method and with the standard ITK implementation of Thirion's Demons algorithm. The new method compares favorably with both approaches, in particular when the distance between the template brain and the target brain is large. We then report the correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic cortical labelings of FTD and control subjects with those gained by the manual rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods tested, SyN's volume measurements are the most strongly correlated with volume measurements gained by expert labeling. This study indicates that SyN, with cross-correlation, is a reliable method for normalizing and making anatomical measurements in volumetric MRI of patients and at-risk elderly individuals.},

We demonstrate the utility of this procedure using artificial and real lesions. The scheme rests on two innovations: First, we augment the generative model used for combined segmentation and normalization of images, with an empirical prior for an atypical tissue class, which can be optimised iteratively. Second, we adopt a fuzzy clustering procedure to identify outlier voxels in normalised gray and white matter segments. These two advances suppress misclassification of voxels and restrict lesion identification to gray/white matter lesions respectively. Our analyses show a high sensitivity for detecting and delineating brain lesions with different sizes, locations, and textures. Our approach has important implications for the generation of lesion overlap maps of a given population and the assessment of lesion-deficit mappings. From a clinical perspective, our method should help to compute the total volume of lesion or to trace precisely lesion boundaries that might be pertinent for surgical or diagnostic purposes. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The remarkable success of magnetic resonance imaging of adult brain relates to the unusually large ratio of the longitudinal relaxation rates 1/T1 of white and gray matter, approximately 2:1 at physiological temperature and traditional imaging fields. Several investigators have conjectured that myelin is the source of the greater 1/T1 of white matter without, however, suggesting details of the molecular mechanisms responsible. From measurements of the magnetic field dependence of 1/T1 (NMRD profiles) of adult and neonatal gray and white matter at 5 and 35 degrees C, we find a thermally activated contribution to the NMRD profile of adult white matter that is not present in the profiles of either adult gray or neonatal gray and white matter. We attribute this contribution to myelin and develop a quantitative model that accounts for the unique relaxation behavior of myelinated white matter. We find that myelin water, 15{\%} of the total, has a relatively short T1 that arises from an unexpectedly large interaction with myelin lipid; when cast in terms of an interaction over the entire myelin bilipid-water interface, it is sevenfold greater than the analogous protein-water interfacial interaction. Its magnitude remains to be accounted for, but cholesterol, known to alter the relaxation rates of lipid protons, may play an important role. The contribution of myelin to 1/T1 at physiological temperatures is attributed to thermally activated transmembrane diffusion of water and, hence, more rapid mixing of axonal and the rapidly relaxing myelin water molecules.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Adjuvant chemotherapy decisions in breast cancer are increasingly based on the pathologist's assessment of tumor proliferation. The Swiss Working Group of Gyneco- and Breast Pathologists has surveyed inter- and intraobserver consistency of Ki-67-based proliferative fraction in breast carcinomas.

METHODS: Five pathologists evaluated MIB-1-labeling index (LI) in ten breast carcinomas (G1, G2, G3) by counting and eyeballing. In the same way, 15 pathologists all over Switzerland then assessed MIB-1-LI on three G2 carcinomas, in self-selected or pre-defined areas of the tumors, comparing centrally immunostained slides with slides immunostained in the different laboratoires. To study intra-observer variability, the same tumors were re-examined 4 months later.

RESULTS: The Kappa values for the first series of ten carcinomas of various degrees of differentiation showed good to very good agreement for MIB-1-LI (Kappa 0.56-0.72). However, we found very high inter-observer variabilities (Kappa 0.04-0.14) in the read-outs of the G2 carcinomas. It was not possible to explain the inconsistencies exclusively by any of the following factors: (i) pathologists' divergent definitions of what counts as a positive nucleus (ii) the mode of assessment (counting vs. eyeballing), (iii) immunostaining technique, and (iv) the selection of the tumor area in which to count. Despite intensive confrontation of all participating pathologists with the problem, inter-observer agreement did not improve when the same slides were re-examined 4 months later (Kappa 0.01-0.04) and intra-observer agreement was likewise poor (Kappa 0.00-0.35).

CONCLUSION: Assessment of mid-range Ki-67-LI suffers from high inter- and intra-observer variability. Oncologists should be aware of this caveat when using Ki-67-LI as a basis for treatment decisions in moderately differentiated breast carcinomas.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE In contrast to "normal-appearing" white matter (NAWM) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), there are subtle, abnormal and diffuse signal intensity changes often seen on T2-weighted MR images, which we have referred to as "dirty-appearing" white matter (DAWM). These areas of DAWM have slightly higher signal intensity than that of NAWM, but lower than that of lesion plaques. Our study was designed to determine the volumetric and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) features of DAWM in patients with MS. METHODS Dual-echo fast spin-echo MR imaging and magnetization transfer imaging were performed in 22 patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Slightly hyperintense DAWM areas were manually outlined on the basis of T2-weighted imaging findings. The volume and MTR of DAWM were calculated and compared with the volume and MTR of NAWM and T2 lesion plaques. RESULTS The average volume of DAWM (18.3 mL) was greater than the average volume of T2 lesion plaques (11.0 mL, P =.04), and the mean MTR in DAWM (38.7{\%}) differed significantly (P {\textless}.0001) from that in NAWM (40.7{\%}) and plaques (33.3{\%}). There was a modest negative correlation between either mean MTR (r = -0.60; P =.003) of DAWM or peak height (r = -0.50; P =.02) of DAWM with T2 lesion load. Neither DAWM volume nor total T2 abnormality (DAWM + plaques) volume correlates with the Expanded Disability Status Scale. CONCLUSION The results of this study indicate that MTR is able to differentiate DAWM from lesion plaques and NAWM and that DAWM might be a different pathologic process of the disease. The notion and quantification of these subtle imaging findings of DAWM areas may improve our understanding of certain stages of disease progression and disease burden in patients with relapsing-remitting MS.},

abstract = {Background and Purpose‚{\"{A}}{\^{i}}This scientific statement provides an overview of the evidence on vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia. Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia of later life are common. Definitions of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), neuropathology, basic science and pathophysiological aspects, role of neuroimaging and vascular and other associated risk factors, and potential opportunities for prevention and treatment are reviewed. This statement serves as an overall guide for practitioners to gain a better understanding of VCI and dementia, prevention, and treatment.Methods‚{\"{A}}{\^{i}}Writing group members were nominated by the writing group co-chairs on the basis of their previous work in relevant topic areas and were approved by the American Heart Association Stroke Council Scientific Statement Oversight Committee, the Council on Epidemiology and Prevention, and the Manuscript Oversight Committee. The writing group used systematic literature reviews (primarily covering publications from 1990 to May 1, 2010), previously published guidelines, personal files, and expert opinion to summarize existing evidence, indicate gaps in current knowledge, and, when appropriate, formulate recommendations using standard American Heart Association criteria. All members of the writing group had the opportunity to comment on the recommendations and approved the final version of this document. After peer review by the American Heart Association, as well as review by the Stroke Council leadership, Council on Epidemiology and Prevention Council, and Scientific Statements Oversight Committee, the statement was approved by the American Heart Association Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee.Results‚{\"{A}}{\^{i}}The construct of VCI has been introduced to capture the entire spectrum of cognitive disorders associated with all forms of cerebral vascular brain injury‚{\"{A}}{\^{i}}not solely stroke‚{\"{A}}{\^{i}}ranging from mild cognitive impairment through fully developed dementia. Dysfunction of the neurovascular unit and mechanisms regulating cerebral blood flow are likely to be important components of the pathophysiological processes underlying VCI. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is emerging as an important marker of risk for Alzheimer disease, microinfarction, microhemorrhage and macrohemorrhage of the brain, and VCI. The neuropathology of cognitive impairment in later life is often a mixture of Alzheimer disease and microvascular brain damage, which may overlap and synergize to heighten the risk of cognitive impairment. In this regard, magnetic resonance imaging and other neuroimaging techniques play an important role in the definition and detection of VCI and provide evidence that subcortical forms of VCI with white matter hyperintensities and small deep infarcts are common. In many cases, risk markers for VCI are the same as traditional risk factors for stroke. These risks may include but are not limited to atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia. Furthermore, these same vascular risk factors may be risk markers for Alzheimer disease. Carotid intimal-medial thickness and arterial stiffness are emerging as markers of arterial aging and may serve as risk markers for VCI. Currently, no specific treatments for VCI have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. However, detection and control of the traditional risk factors for stroke and cardiovascular disease may be effective in the prevention of VCI, even in older people.Conclusions‚{\"{A}}{\^{i}}Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia are important. Understanding of VCI has evolved substantially in recent years, based on preclinical, neuropathologic, neuroimaging, physiological, and epidemiological studies. Transdisciplinary, translational, and transactional approaches are recommended to further our understanding of this entity and to better characterize its neuropsychological profile. There is a need for prospective, quantitative, clinical-pathological-neuroimaging studies to improve know edge of the pathological basis of neuroimaging change and the complex interplay between vascular and Alzheimer disease pathologies in the evolution of clinical VCI and Alzheimer disease. Long-term vascular risk marker interventional studies beginning as early as midlife may be required to prevent or postpone the onset of VCI and Alzheimer disease. Studies of intensive reduction of vascular risk factors in high-risk groups are another important avenue of research.},

abstract = {We propose a dual pathway, 11-layers deep, three-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network for the challenging task of brain lesion segmentation. The devised architecture is the result of an in-depth analysis of the limitations of current networks proposed for similar applications. To overcome the computational burden of processing 3D medical scans, we have developed an efficient and effective dense training scheme which automatically adapts to the inherent class imbalance present in the data. The training makes use of the notion of image segments which joins multiple patches from the same image into one pass through the network. Further, we analyze the development of deeper, thus more discriminative 3D CNNs. In order to incorporate both local and larger contextual information, we employ a dual pathway architecture that processes the input images at multiple scales simultaneously. For post-processing of the network's soft segmentation, we use a 3D fully connected Conditional Random Field which effectively removes false positives. Our pipeline is extensively evaluated on three challenging tasks of lesion segmentation in multi-channel MRI patient data with traumatic brain injuries, brain tumors, and ischemic stroke. We improve on the state-of-the-art for all three applications, with top ranking performance on the public benchmarks BRATS 2015 and ISLES 2015. Our method is computationally efficient and achieves a segmentation of a brain scan in less than six minutes. The source code of our implementation is made publicly available.},

abstract = {Digital pathology represents one of the major evolutions in modern medicine. Pathological examinations constitute the gold standard in many medical protocols, and also play a critical and legal role in the diagnosis process. In the conventional cancer diagnosis, pathologists analyze biopsies to make diagnostic and prognostic assessments, mainly based on the cell morphology and architecture distribution. Recently, computerized methods have been rapidly evolving in the area of digital pathology, with growing applications related to nuclei detection, segmentation, and classification. In cancer research, these approaches have played, and will continue to play a key (often bottleneck) role in minimizing human intervention, consolidating pertinent second opinions, and providing traceable clinical information. Pathological studies have been conducted for numerous cancer detection and grading applications, including brain, breast, cervix, lung, and prostate cancer grading. Our study presents, discusses, and extracts the major trends from an exhaustive overview of various nuclei detection, segmentation, feature computation, and classification techniques used in histopathology imagery, specifically in hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemical staining protocols. This study also enables us to measure the challenges that remain, in order to reach robust analysis of whole slide images, essential high content imaging with diagnostic biomarkers and prognosis support in digital pathology.},

abstract = {Investigations into the cellular and molecular biology of genes that cause inherited forms of Parkinson's disease, as well as the downstream pathways that they trigger, shed considerable light on our understanding the fundamental determinants of life and death in dopaminergic neurons. Homozygous deletion or missense mutation in DJ-1 results in autosomal recessively inherited Parkinson's disease, suggesting that wild-type DJ-1 has a favorable role in maintaining these neurons. Here, we show that DJ-1 protects against oxidative stress-induced cell death, but that its relatively modest ability to quench reactive oxygen species is insufficient to account for its more robust cytoprotective effect. To elucidate the mechanism of this cell-preserving function, we have screened out the death protein Daxx as a DJ-1-interacting partner. We demonstrate that wild-type DJ-1 sequesters Daxx in the nucleus, prevents it from gaining access to the cytoplasm, from binding to and activating its effector kinase apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, and therefore, from triggering the ensuing death pathway. All these steps are impaired by the disease-causing L166P mutant isoform of DJ-1. These findings suggest that the regulated sequestration of Daxx in the nucleus and keeping apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 activation in check is a critical mechanism by which DJ-1 exerts its cytoprotective function.},

SENSE acquisitions have usually been modeled as Rician distributed, since the data reconstruction takes place into the spatial domain, where Gaussian noise is assumed. However, this model just holds for the first order statistics and obviates other effects induced by coils correlations and the reconstruction interpolation. Those effects are properly taken into account in this study, in order to fully justify a final SENSE noise model. As a result, some interesting features of the reconstructed image arise: (1) There is a strong correlation between adjacent lines. (2) The resulting distribution is non-stationary and therefore the variance of noise will vary from point to point across the image. Closed equations for the calculation of the variance of noise and the correlation coefficient between lines are proposed. The proposed model is totally compatible with g-factor formulations.},

In clinical trials, lesion load is observed by manually segmenting and comparing serial MR images, which is time consuming, costly, and prone to inter- and intraobserver variability. Subtracting images from consecutive time points nulls stable lesions, leaving only new lesion activity. We propose SuBLIME, an automated method for segmenting incident lesion voxels.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We used logistic regression models incorporating multiple MR imaging sequences and subtraction images from consecutive longitudinal studies to estimate voxel-level probabilities of lesion incidence.

abstract = {Precise detection and quantification of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) observed in T2-weighted Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) is of substantial interest in aging, and age-related neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). This is mainly because WMH may reflect co-morbid neural injury or cerebral vascular disease burden. WMH in the older population may be small, diffuse, and irregular in shape, and sufficiently heterogeneous within and across subjects. Here, we pose hyperintensity detection as a supervised inference problem and adapt two learning models, specifically, Support Vector Machines and Random Forests, for this task. Using texture features engineered by texton filter banks, we provide a suite of effective segmentation methods for this problem. Through extensive evaluations on healthy middle-aged and older adults who vary in AD risk, we show that our methods are reliable and robust in segmenting hyperintense regions. A measure of hyperintensity accumulation, referred to as normalized effective WMH volume, is shown to be associated with dementia in older adults and parental family history in cognitively normal subjects. We provide an open source library for hyperintensity detection and accumulation (interfaced with existing neuroimaging tools), that can be adapted for segmentation problems in other neuroimaging studies.},

abstract = {Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows for quantitative assessment of hyperintense foci, which are seen with aging and various diseases. These foci, considered to represent lesions, are important in the study of various psychiatric illnesses, including depression. Few quantitative measures have been developed for such research. The goal of the current study was to develop a reliable and efficient method for quantifying the volumes of gray and white matter lesions in MRI scans of the elderly. Interrater reliability was determined by repeat lesion measures on 16 scans. Semi-automated segmentation was performed that identified potential lesions, and then lesions were manually selected based upon detailed anatomic criteria. The lesion quantification procedure took between 25 and 45 min per scan. Reliability intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were 0.99 for both gray and white matter lesions. Volumetric results were found to be moderately correlated with previous lesion ratings (r-values between 0.37 and 0.62, P{\textless}0.0001). Among the 700 scans processed with this method, lesion volumes ranged from 0 to 7.3 ml for gray matter, and from 0.4 to 96.8 ml for white matter. Our method proved to be efficient and reliable for quantifying lesions in MRI scans of the elderly. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {All fields of neuroscience that employ brain imaging need to communicate their results with reference to anatomical regions. In particular, comparative morphometry and group analysis of functional and physiological data require coregistration of brains to establish correspondences across brain structures. It is well established that linear registration of one brain to another is inadequate for aligning brain structures, so numerous algorithms have emerged to nonlinearly register brains to one another. This study is the largest evaluation of nonlinear deformation algorithms applied to brain image registration ever conducted. Fourteen algorithms from laboratories around the world are evaluated using 8 different error measures. More than 45,000 registrations between 80 manually labeled brains were performed by algorithms including: AIR, ANIMAL, ART, Diffeomorphic Demons, FNIRT, IRTK, JRD-fluid, ROMEO, SICLE, SyN, and four different SPM5 algorithms ("SPM2-type" and regular Normalization, Unified Segmentation, and the DARTEL Toolbox). All of these registrations were preceded by linear registration between the same image pairs using FLIRT. One of the most significant findings of this study is that the relative performances of the registration methods under comparison appear to be little affected by the choice of subject population, labeling protocol, and type of overlap measure. This is important because it suggests that the findings are generalizable to new subject populations that are labeled or evaluated using different labeling protocols. Furthermore, we ranked the 14 methods according to three completely independent analyses (permutation tests, one-way ANOVA tests, and indifference-zone ranking) and derived three almost identical top rankings of the methods. ART, SyN, IRTK, and SPM's DARTEL Toolbox gave the best results according to overlap and distance measures, with ART and SyN delivering the most consistently high accuracy across subjects and label sets. Updates will be published on the http://www.mindboggle.info/papers/ website.},

abstract = {Objective Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is a widely used reliability index in test-retest, intrarater, and interrater reliability analyses. This article introduces the basic concept of ICC in the content of reliability analysis. Discussion for Researchers There are 10 forms of ICCs. Because each form involves distinct assumptions in their calculation and will lead to different interpretations, researchers should explicitly specify the ICC form they used in their calculation. A thorough review of the research design is needed in selecting the appropriate form of ICC to evaluate reliability. The best practice of reporting ICC should include software information, ???model,??? ???type,??? and ???definition??? selections. Discussion for Readers When coming across an article that includes ICC, readers should first check whether information about the ICC form has been reported and if an appropriate ICC form was used. Based on the 95{\%} confident interval of the ICC estimate, values less than 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and greater than 0.90 are indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability, respectively. Conclusion This article provides a practical guideline for clinical researchers to choose the correct form of ICC and suggests the best practice of reporting ICC parameters in scientific publications. This article also gives readers an appreciation for what to look for when coming across ICC while reading an article.},

Whole-head synthetic image phantoms with manually introduced leukoaraiosis lesions of varying severity were constructed. These synthetic image phantom sets incorporated image contrast and anatomic features that mimicked leukoaraiosis found in real life. One set of synthetic image phantoms was used to develop the segmentation algorithm (FLAIR-histoseg). A second set was used to measure its accuracy. Test retest reproducibility was assessed in 10 elderly volunteers who were imaged twice. The mean absolute error of the FLAIR-histoseg method was 6.6{\%} for measurement of leukoaraiosis volume and 1.4{\%} for brain volume. The mean test retest coefficient of variation was 1.4{\%} for leukoaraiosis volume and 0.3{\%} for brain volume. We conclude that the FLAIR-histoseg method is an accurate and reproducible method for measuring leukoaraiosis and whole-brain volume in elderly subjects.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to the correction of intensity inhomogeneities in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that significantly improves intensity-based tissue segmentation. The distortion of the image brightness values by a low-frequency bias field impedes visual inspection and segmentation. The new correction method called parametric bias field correction (PABIC) is based on a simplified model of the imaging process, a parametric model of tissue class statistics, and a polynomial model of the inhomogeneity field. We assume that the image is composed of pixels assigned to a small number of categories with a priori known statistics. Further we assume that the image is corrupted by noise and a low-frequency inhomogeneity field. The estimation of the parametric bias field is formulated as a nonlinear energy minimization problem using an evolution strategy (ES). The resulting bias field is independent of the image region configurations and thus overcomes limitations of methods based on homomorphic filtering. Furthermore, PABIC can correct bias distortions much larger than the image contrast. Input parameters are the intensity statistics of the classes and the degree of the polynomial function. The polynomial approach combines bias correction with histogram adjustment, making it well suited for normalizing the intensity histogram of datasets from serial studies. We present simulations and a quantitative validation with phantom and test images. A large number of MR image data acquired with breast, surface, and head coils, both in two dimensions and three dimensions, have been processed and demonstrate the versatility and robustness of this new bias correction scheme.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: White matter hyperintensities are characteristic of old age and identifiable on FLAIR and T2-weighted MR imaging. They are typically separated into periventricular or deep categories. It is unclear whether the innermost segment of periventricular white matter hyperintensities is truly abnormal or is imaging artifacts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used FLAIR MR imaging from 665 community-dwelling subjects 72-73 years of age without dementia. Periventricular white matter hyperintensities were visually allocated into 4 categories: 1) thin white line; 2) thick rim; 3) penetrating toward or confluent with deep white matter hyperintensities; and 4) diffuse ill-defined, labeled as "subtle extended periventricular white matter hyperintensities." We measured the maximum intensity and width of the periventricular white matter hyperintensities, mapped all white matter hyperintensities in 3D, and investigated associations between each category and hypertension, stroke, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, cardiovascular disease, and total white matter hyperintensity volume. RESULTS: The intensity patterns and morphologic features were different for each periventricular white matter hyperintensity category. Both the widths (r = 0.61, P {\textless} .001) and intensities (r = 0.51, P {\textless} .001) correlated with total white matter hyperintensity volume and with each other (r = 0.55, P {\textless} .001) for all categories with the exception of subtle extended periventricular white matter hyperintensities, largely characterized by evidence of erratic, ill-defined, and fragmented pale white matter hyperintensities (width: r = 0.02, P = .11; intensity: r = 0.02, P = .84). The prevalence of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and neuroradiologic evidence of stroke increased from periventricular white matter hyperintensity categories 1 to 3. The mean periventricular white matter hyperintensity width was significantly larger in subjects with hypertension (mean difference = 0.5 mm, P = .029) or evidence of stroke (mean difference = 1 mm, P {\textless} .001). 3D mapping revealed that periventricular white matter hyperintensities were discontinuous with deep white matter hyperintensities in all categories, except only in particular regions in brains with category 3. CONCLUSIONS: Periventricular white matter hyperintensity intensity levels, distribution, and association with risk factors and disease suggest that in old age, these are true tissue abnormalities and therefore should not be dismissed as artifacts. Dichotomizing periventricular and deep white matter hyperintensities by continuity from the ventricle edge toward the deep white matter is possible.},

abstract = {We propose a novel segmentation approach based on deep 3D convolutional encoder networks with shortcut connections and apply it to the segmentation of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions in magnetic resonance images. Our model is a neural network that consists of two interconnected pathways, a convolutional pathway, which learns increasingly more abstract and higher-level image features, and a deconvolutional pathway, which predicts the final segmentation at the voxel level. The joint training of the feature extraction and prediction pathways allows for the automatic learning of features at different scales that are optimized for accuracy for any given combination of image types and segmentation task. In addition, shortcut connections between the two pathways allow high- and low-level features to be integrated, which enables the segmentation of lesions across a wide range of sizes. We have evaluated our method on two publicly available data sets (MICCAI 2008 and ISBI 2015 challenges) with the results showing that our method performs comparably to the top-ranked state-of-the-art methods, even when only relatively small data sets are available for training. In addition, we have evaluated our method on a large data set from an MS clinical trial, with a comparison of network architectures of different depths and with and without shortcut connections. The results show that increasing depth from three to seven layers improves performance, and adding shortcut connections further increases accuracy. For a direct comparison, we also ran the same data set through five freely available and widely used MS lesion segmentation methods, namely EMS, LST-LPA, LST-LGA, Lesion-TOADS, and SLS. The results show that our method consistently outperforms these other methods across a wide range of lesion sizes.},

@article{Tu2014,
abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating disease characterized by synaptic and neuronal loss in the elderly. Compelling evidence suggests that soluble amyloid-$\beta$ peptide (A$\beta$) oligomers induce synaptic loss in AD. A$\beta$-induced synaptic dysfunction is dependent on overstimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) resulting in aberrant activation of redox-mediated events as well as elevation of cytoplasmic Ca 2+ , which in turn triggers downstream pathways involving phospho-tau (p-tau), caspases, Cdk5/dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), calcineurin/PP2B, PP2A, Gsk-3$\beta$, Fyn, cofilin, and CaMKII and causes endocytosis of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) as well as NMDARs. Dysfunction in these pathways leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, bioenergetic compromise and consequent synaptic dysfunction and loss, impaired long-term potentiation (LTP), and cognitive decline. Evidence also suggests that A$\beta$ may, at least in part, mediate these events by causing an aberrant rise in extrasynaptic glutamate levels by inhibiting glutamate uptake or triggering glutamate release from glial cells. Consequent extrasynaptic NMDAR (eNMDAR) overstimulation then results in synaptic dysfunction via the aforementioned pathways. Consistent with this model of A$\beta$-induced synaptic loss, A$\beta$ synaptic toxicity can be partially ameliorated by the NMDAR antagonists (such as memantine and NitroMemantine). PSD-95, an important scaffolding protein that regulates synaptic distribution and activity of both NMDA and AMPA receptors, is also functionally disrupted by A$\beta$. PSD-95 dysregulation is likely an important intermediate step in the pathological cascade of events caused by A$\beta$. In summary, A$\beta$-induced synaptic dysfunction is a complicated process involving multiple pathways, components and biological events, and their underlying mechanisms, albeit as yet incompletely understood, may offer hope for new therapeutic avenues.},

@phdthesis{Khademi2012a,
abstract = {This thesis is focused on automatic detection of white matter lesions (WML) in Fluid Attenuation Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) of the brain. There is growing interest within the medical community regarding WML, since the total WML volume per patient (lesion load) was shown to be related to future stroke as well as carotid disease. Manual segmentation of WML is time consuming, labourious, observer-dependent and error prone. Automatic WML segmentation algorithms can be used instead since they give way to lesion load computation in a quantitative, efficient, reproducible and reliable manner. FLAIR MRI are affected by at least two types of degradations, including additive noise and the partial volume averaging (PVA) artifact, which affect the accuracy of automated algorithms. Model-based methods that rely on Gaussian distributions have been extensively used to handle these two distortions, but are not applicable to FLAIR with WML. The distribution of noise in multicoil FLAIR MRI is non-Gaussian and the presence of WML modifies tissue distributions in a manner that is difficult to model. To this end, the current thesis presents a novel way to model PVA artifacts in the presence of noise. The method is a generalized and adaptive approach, that was applied to a variety of MRI weightings (with and without pathology) for robust PVA quantification and tissue segmentation. No a priori assumptions are needed regarding class distributions and no training samples or initialization parameters are required. Segmentation experiments were completed using simulated and real FLAIR MRI. Simulated images were generated with noise and PVA distortions using realistic brain and pathology models. Real images were obtained from Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and WML ground truth was generated through a manual segmentation experiment. The average DSC was found to be 0.99 and 0.83 for simulated and real images, respectively. A lesion load study was performed that examined interhemispheric WML volume for each patient. To show the generalized nature of the approach, the proposed technique was also employed on pathology-free T1 and T2 MRI. Validation studies show the proposed framework is classifying PVA robustly and tissue classes are segmented with good results.},

We believe that such comparisons can help the research community and industry to develop better algorithms. We support the organization of these comparative studies and the dissemination of their results. Organizing and participating in challenges is not the only way to facilitate better comparisons between new and existing solutions. If it were easy to publish and share your data, and the code you used to evaluate your algorithm's performance on that data, and possibly the algorithm itself, others could directly compare their approach to yours, using the same test data and the same evaluation metrics. With this site we provide tools to make it as easy as possible for you to publish your data and your evaluation for any paper you've written.},

abstract = {A dramatic shift has occurred in how biologists use microscopy images. Whether experiments are small-scale or high-throughput, automatically quantifying biological properties in images is now widespread. We see yet another revolution under way: a transition towards using automated image analysis to not only identify phenotypes a biologist specifically seeks to measure ('screening') but also as an unbiased and sensitive tool to capture a wide variety of subtle features of cell (or organism) state ('profiling'). Mapping similarities among samples using image-based (morphological) profiling has tremendous potential to transform drug discovery, functional genomics, and basic biological research. Applications include target identification, lead hopping, library enrichment, functionally annotating genes/alleles, and identifying small molecule modulators of gene activity and disease-specific phenotypes.},

abstract = {Spurred by advances in processing power, memory, storage, and an unprecedented wealth of data, computers are being asked to tackle increasingly complex learning tasks, often with astonishing success. Computers have now mastered a popular variant of poker, learned the laws of physics from experimental data, and become experts in video games - tasks that would have been deemed impossible not too long ago. In parallel, the number of companies centered on applying complex data analysis to varying industries has exploded, and it is thus unsurprising that some analytic companies are turning attention to problems in health care. The purpose of this review is to explore what problems in medicine might benefit from such learning approaches and use examples from the literature to introduce basic concepts in machine learning. It is important to note that seemingly large enough medical data sets and adequate learning algorithms have been available for many decades, and yet, although there are thousands of papers applying machine learning algorithms to medical data, very few have contributed meaningfully to clinical care. This lack of impact stands in stark contrast to the enormous relevance of machine learning to many other industries. Thus, part of my effort will be to identify what obstacles there may be to changing the practice of medicine through statistical learning approaches, and discuss how these might be overcome.},

abstract = {Our purpose in this study was to develop an automated segmentation scheme for multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions in magnetic resonance images using an artificial neural network (ANN)-controlled level-set method. Forty-nine slices with T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images were selected from six examinations of three MS patients including 168 MS lesions for this study. First, MS lesions were enhanced by background subtraction. Initial regions of MS candidates were detected based on a multiple-gray-level thresholding technique and a region-growing technique on the subtraction image. Then, final regions of MS candidates were determined by application of a proposed segmentation method using an ANN-controlled level-set method, which was used for reduction of false positives (FPs) as well as more accurate segmentation. Finally, all candidate regions were classified into true positive and FP candidate regions by use of a support vector machine. As the result of a leave-one-candidate-out test method, the detection sensitivity for MS lesions increased from 64.9 to 75.0{\%} while decreasing the number of FPs per slice from 19.9 to 4.4 compared with a previous study. The proposed scheme improved the sensitivity and the number of FPs in the detection of MS lesions.},

The proposed approach, based on a Bayesian classifier, utilizes the adaptive mixtures method (AMM) and Markov random field (MRF) model to obtain and upgrade the class conditional probability density function (CCPDF) and the a priori probability of each class. To compare the performance of the proposed approach with those of previous approaches including manual segmentation, the similarity criteria of different slices related to 20 MS patients were calculated. Also, volumetric comparison of lesions volume between the fully automated segmentation and the gold standard was performed using correlation coefficient (CC). The results showed a better performance for the proposed approach, compared to those of previous works.},

@article{Zhang2001,
abstract = {The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a histogram-based model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation-no spatial information is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not the the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias field distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods produce unreliable results. Here, the authors propose a novel hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically, it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the HMRF model. The advantage of the HMRF model derives from the way in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences of neighboring sites. Although MRF modeling has been employed in MR image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods are limited to using MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based approach. To fit the HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. The authors show that by incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into a HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved. More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be combined with other techniques. As an example, the authors show how the bias field correction algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997) can be incorporated into this framework to achieve a three-dimensional fully automated approach for brain MR image segmentation.},

Nevertheless they have not yet been fully exploited for image processing applications. In this paper we present a variational Bayes (VB) approach for image segmentation. We aim to show that VB provides a framework for generalising existing segmentation algorithms that rely on an expectation???maximisation formulation, while increasing their robustness and computational stability. We also show how optimal model complexity can be automatically determined in a variational setting, as opposed to ML frameworks which are intrinsically prone to overfitting. Finally, we demonstrate how suitable intensity priors, that can be used in combination with the presented algorithm, can be learned from large imaging data sets by adopting an empirical Bayes approach.},

abstract = {Background and objectives—It is widely accepted that typical acute demyelinating lesions in relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) exhibit vasogenic edema with increased diffusion, as demonstrated by an increased apparent diffusion coefficient on MRI. In contrast, acute ischemic lesions demonstrate cytotoxic edema with restricted diffusion. Recent reports have documented selected cases of acute demyelinating lesions exhibiting restricted diffusion (ADLRD) in MS. We aimed to assess the morphologies, distributions, signal characteristics and changes over time of nine ADLRD. An additional goal was to obtain clinical correlations and relate our findings to all previously published case reports describing ADLRD. Methods—A retrospective case series study was performed at two academic centers. MRI characteristics of nine ADLRD found in six RRMS patients were compared with typical active symptomatic contrast-enhancing lesions with increased or normal diffusion in control RRMS patients. Results—The average size of ADLRD was not significantly different from typical lesions. Aperiventricular location and faint signal on T2-weighted images were significantly more common for ADLRD compared with typical lesions. Two patients with ADLRD on initial MRI exhibited new ADLRD on their follow up scans. Conclusion—Our results and review of prior published cases suggest that ADLRD represent a new variant of MS lesion. The restricted diffusion that is a characteristic of ADLRD on MRI is a new challenge in the differential diagnosis of stroke in young adults. The pathogenesis of ADLRD remains to be understood.},

After preprocessing, including co-registration, brain extraction, bias correction, and intensity standardization, 49 features are calculated for each brain voxel based on local morphometry. At each level of segmentation a supervised classifier takes advantage of a different subset of the features to conservatively segment lesion voxels, passing on more difficult voxels to the next classifier.

abstract = {The presence of large number of false lesion classification on segmented brain MR images is a major problem in the accurate determination of lesion volumes in multiple sclerosis (MS) brains. In order to minimize the false lesion classifications, a strategy that combines parametric and nonparametric techniques is developed and implemented. This approach uses the information from the proton density (PD)- and T2-weighted and fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. This strategy involves CSF and lesion classification using the Parzen window classifier. Image processing, morphological operations, and ratio maps of PD- and T2-weighted images are used for minimizing false positives. Contextual information is exploited for minimizing the false negative lesion classifications using hidden Markov random field-expectation maximization (HMRF-EM) algorithm. Lesions are delineated using fuzzy connectivity. The performance of this algorithm is quantitatively evaluated on 23 MS patients. Similarity index, percentages of over, under, and correct estimations of lesions are computed by spatially comparing the results of present procedure with expert manual segmentation. The automated processing scheme detected 80{\%} of the manually segmented lesions in the case of low lesion load and 93{\%} of the lesions in those cases with high lesion load.},

abstract = {Purpose: Pathologists often look at whole slide images (WSIs) at low magnification to find potentially important regions and then zoom in to higher magnification to perform more sophisticated analysis of the tissue structures. Many automated methods of WSI analysis attempt to preprocess the down-sampled image in order to select salient regions which are then further analyzed by a more computationally intensive step at full magnification. Although it can greatly reduce processing times, this process may lead to small potentially important regions being overlooked at low magnification. We propose a texture analysis technique to ease the processing of H{\&}E stained WSIs by triaging clinically important regions. Method: Image patches randomly selected from the whole tissue area were divided into smaller tiles and Gaussian-like texture filters were applied to them. Texture filter responses from each tile were combined together and statistical measures were derived from their histograms of responses. Bag of visual words pipeline was then employed to combine extracted features from tiles to form one histogram of words per every image patch. A support vector machine classifier was trained using the calculated histograms of words to be able to distinguish between clinically relevant and irrelevant patches. Result: Experimental analysis on 5151 image patches from 10 patient cases (65 tissue slides) indicated that our proposed texture technique out-performed two previously proposed colour and intensity based methods with an area under the ROC curve of 0.87. Conclusion: Texture features can be employed to triage clinically important areas within large WSIs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Whole brain volume (WBV) estimates in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) correlate more robustly with clinical disability than traditional, lesion-based metrics. Numerous algorithms to measure WBV have been developed over the past two decades. We compare Structural Image Evaluation using Normalisation of Atrophy-Cross-sectional (SIENAX) to NeuroQuant and MSmetrix, for assessment of cross-sectional WBV in patients with MS. METHODS: MRIs from 61 patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 2 patients with clinically isolated syndrome were analysed. WBV measurements were calculated using SIENAX, NeuroQuant and MSmetrix. Statistical agreement between the methods was evaluated using linear regression and Bland-Altman plots. Precision and accuracy of WBV measurement was calculated for (1) NeuroQuant versus SIENAX and (2) MSmetrix versus SIENAX. RESULTS: Precision (Pearson's r) of WBV estimation for NeuroQuant and MSmetrix versus SIENAX was 0.983 and 0.992, respectively. Accuracy (Cb) was 0.871 and 0.994, respectively. NeuroQuant and MSmetrix showed a 5.5{\%} and 1.0{\%} volume difference compared with SIENAX, respectively, that was consistent across low and high values. CONCLUSIONS: In the analysed population, NeuroQuant and MSmetrix both quantified cross-sectional WBV with comparable statistical agreement to SIENAX, a well-validated cross-sectional tool that has been used extensively in MS clinical studies.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Lesion segmentation plays an important role in the diagnosis and follow-up of multiple sclerosis (MS). This task is very time-consuming and subject to intra- and inter-rater variability. In this paper, we present a new tool for automated MS lesion segmentation using T1w and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. METHODS: Our approach is based on two main steps, initial brain tissue segmentation according to the gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) performed in T1w images, followed by a second step where the lesions are segmented as outliers to the normal apparent GM brain tissue on the FLAIR image. RESULTS: The tool has been validated using data from more than 100 MS patients acquired with different scanners and at different magnetic field strengths. Quantitative evaluation provided a better performance in terms of precision while maintaining similar results on sensitivity and Dice similarity measures compared with those of other approaches. CONCLUSION: Our tool is implemented as a publicly available SPM8/12 extension that can be used by both the medical and research communities.},

abstract = {A review of 15 recent publications purporting to provide the relaxation times of CSF reveals a considerable disparity in the quoted results, by a factor of five in terms of T1 (range 1,000 to 5,500 ms) and by a factor of 16 for T2 (range 166 to 2,640 ms). In this article measurements are performed independently on both a spectrometer and an imager. The results indicate that for CSF T1 is greater than 3,000 ms and T2 is approximately 2,000 ms at 6 MHz. The vast differences in relaxation behaviour between CSF and other body tissues have considerable clinical implications and present profound diagnostic opportunities. The application of this knowledge to ventriculography, myelography, and image contrast methodology is discussed.},

Transport studies with celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen, meloxicam, piroxicam and tenoxicam were accomplished across Transwell models based on cell line PBMEC/C1-2, ECV304 or primary rat brain endothelial cells. Single as well as group substance studies were carried out. In group studies substance group compositions, transport medium and serum content were varied, transport inhibitors verapamil and probenecid were added. Resulted permeability coefficients were compared and normalized to internal standards diazepam and carboxyfluorescein. Transport rankings of NSAIDs across each model were obtained. Single substance studies showed similar rankings as corresponding group studies across PBMEC/C1-2 or ECV304 cell layers. Serum content, glioma conditioned medium and inhibitors probenecid and verapamil influenced resulted permeability significantly. Basic differences of transport properties of the investigated NSAIDs were similar comparing all three in vitro BBB models. Different substance combinations in the group studies and addition of probenecid and verapamil suggested that transporter proteins are involved in the transport of every tested NSAID. Results especially underlined the importance of same experimental conditions (transport medium, serum content, species origin, cell line) for proper data comparison.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop a flexible method of separation and quantification of immunohistochemical staining by means of color image analysis.

STUDY DESIGN: An algorithm was developed to deconvolve the color information acquired with red-green-blue (RGB) cameras and to calculate the contribution of each of the applied stains based on stain-specific RGB absorption. The algorithm was tested using different combinations of diaminobenzidine, hematoxylin and eosin at different staining levels.

RESULTS: Quantification of the different stains was not significantly influenced by the combination of multiple stains in a single sample. The color deconvolution algorithm resulted in comparable quantification independent of the stain combinations as long as the histochemical procedures did not influence the amount of stain in the sample due to bleaching because of stain solubility and saturation of staining was prevented.

CONCLUSION: This image analysis algorithm provides a robust and flexible method for objective immunohistochemical analysis of samples stained with up to three different stains using a laboratory microscope, standard RGB camera setup and the public domain program NIH Image.},

abstract = {Objectives Dementia is foremost a clinical diagnosis. However, in diagnosing dementia, it is advocated to perform at least one neuroimaging study. This has two purposes: to rule out potential reversible dementia (PRD), and to help determine the dementia subtype. Our first goal was to establish if MRI combined with visual rating scales changes the clinical diagnosis. The second goal was to demonstrate if MRI contributes to a geriatrician's confidence in the diagnosis. Methods The dementia subtype was determined prior to and after MRI. Scoring scales used were: global cortical atrophy (GCA), medial temporal atrophy (MTA), and white matter hyperintensity measured according to the Fazekas scale. The confidence level of the geriatrician was determined using a visual analogue scale. Results One hundred and thirty-five patients were included. After MRI, the diagnosis changed in 23.7 {\%} (CI 17.0 {\%}-31.1 {\%}) of patients. Change was due to vascular aetiology in 13.3 {\%} of patients. PRD was found in 2.2 {\%} of all patients. The confidence level in the diagnosis increased significantly after MRI (p = 0.001). Conclusions MRI, combined with visual rating scales, has a significant impact on dementia subtype diagnosis and on a geriatrician's confidence in the final diagnosis. Key points • MRI with visual rating scales changes the dementia subtype diagnosis significantly. • MRI is essential in demonstrating vascular disease as a cause of dementia. • All suspected dementia patients should undergo an MRI with visual rating scales. • MRI improves a geriatrician's confidence in the diagnosis of the dementia subtype. • MRI remains essential during the workup of dementia to exclude reversible causes.},

Compared with other current criteria, these guidelines emphasize (1) the heterogeneity of vascular dementia syndromes and pathologic subtypes including ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, cerebral hypoxic-ischemic events, and senile leukoencephalopathic lesions; (2) the variability in clinical course, which may be static, remitting, or progressive; (3) specific clinical findings early in the course (eg, gait disorder, incontinence, or mood and personality changes) that support a vascular rather than a degenerative cause; (4) the need to establish a temporal relationship between stroke and dementia onset for a secure diagnosis; (5) the importance of brain imaging to support clinical findings; (6) the value of neuropsychological testing to document impairments in multiple cognitive domains; and (7) a protocol for neuropathologic evaluations and correlative studies of clinical, radiologic, and neuropsychological features. These criteria are intended as a guide for case definition in neuroepidemiologic studies, stratified by levels of certainty (definite, probable, and possible).

abstract = {S troke is a leading cause of disability in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death. 1 An acute ischemic stroke (AIS) occurs when an artery supplying the brain becomes oc-cluded, leading to the death of brain tissue and focal neurological deficits. An estimated 700 000 ischemic strokes occur in the United States each year, costing more than {\$}70 billion to society. 1 The toll exerted on individual patients and families by a devastating stroke is incalculable; most elderly patients fear a disabling stroke more than they fear death. 2 Thus, improving neurological outcome after an is-chemic stroke is a major societal priority and has attracted intense attention of clinical and basic researchers, government funding agen-cies, and industry. Consistent with animal models of ischemia, the overarching goal of AIS therapy is relieving the arterial occlusion (recanalization) and restoring cerebral blood flow (reperfusion) as soon as possible to reduce tissue injury and improve outcomes. There is general consensus based on strong evidence that in pa-tients presenting within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV rtPA) therapy is ben-eficial. However, many patients present with occlusion of a large proximal artery beyond 4.5 hours or have contraindications to sys-temic thrombolysis (ie, recent major surgery or active bleeding). For these reasons and because proximal artery occlusions are rela-tively resistant to intravenous thrombolysis, catheter-based or intra-arterial approaches to directly remove the clot and restore blood flow to the brain have been the focus of recent randomized clinical trials. We review acute stroke treatment with an emphasis on intra-IMPORTANCE Acute ischemic stroke is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States. We review the latest data and evidence supporting catheter-directed treatment for proximal artery occlusion as an adjunct to intravenous thrombolysis in patients with acute stroke. OBJECTIVE To review the pathophysiology of acute brain ischemia and infarction and the evidence supporting various stroke reperfusion treatments. EVIDENCE REVIEW Systematic literature search of MEDLINE databases published between January 1, 1990, and February 11, 2015, was performed to identify studies addressing the role of thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy in acute stroke management. Studies included randomized clinical trials, observational studies, guideline statements, and review articles. Sixty-eight articles (N = 108 082 patients) were selected for review. FINDINGS Intravenous thrombolysis is the mainstay of acute ischemic stroke management for any patient with disabling deficits presenting within 4.5 hours from symptom onset. Randomized trials have demonstrated that more patients return to having good function (defined by being independent and having slight disability or less) when treated within 4.5 hours after symptom onset with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV rtPA) therapy. Mechanical thrombectomy in select patients with acute ischemic stroke and proximal artery occlusions has demonstrated substantial rates of partial or complete arterial recanalization and improved outcomes compared with IV rtPA or best medical treatment alone in multiple randomized clinical trials. Regardless of mode of reperfusion, earlier reperfusion is associated with better clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Intravenous rtPA remains the standard of care for patients with moderate to severe neurological deficits who present within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. Outcomes for some patients with acute ischemic stroke and moderate to severe neurological deficits due to proximal artery occlusion are improved with endovascular reperfusion therapy. Efforts to hasten reperfusion therapy, regardless of the mode, should be undertaken within organized stroke systems of care. Systematic literature search of MEDLINE databases published be-tween January 1, 1990, and February 11, 2015, was performed to iden-tify studies addressing the role of thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy in acute stroke management. We searched Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms in multiple combinations includ-ing brain ischemia/drug therapy, stroke drug/therapy, tissue plas-minogen activator, fibrinolytic agents, endovascular procedures, thrombectomy, time factors, emergency service, treatment out-come, multicenter study, and randomized controlled trial. Studies re-porting outcomes from acute thrombolysis and mechanical throm-bectomy were included for review. The search was limited to human studies without language restrictions applied. This search was supple-mented by reviewing additional references from included studies. Sixty-eight articles (N = 108 082 patients) were selected for re-view (eFigure in the Supplement). Background},

We report here that human DJ-1 and its homologs of the mouse and Caenorhabditis elegans are novel types of glyoxalase, converting glyoxal or methylglyoxal to glycolic or lactic acid, respectively, in the absence of glutathione. Purified DJ-1 proteins exhibit typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics, which were abolished completely in the mutants of essential catalytic residues, consisting of cysteine and glutamic acid. The presence of DJ-1 protected mouse embryonic fibroblast and dopaminergically derived SH-SY5Y cells from treatments of glyoxals. Likewise, C. elegans lacking cDJR-1.1, a DJ-1 homolog expressed primarily in the intestine, protected worms from glyoxal-induced death. Sub-lethal doses of glyoxals caused significant degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in C. elegans lacking cDJR-1.2, another DJ-1 homolog expressed primarily in the head region, including neurons. Our findings that DJ-1 serves as scavengers for reactive carbonyl species may provide a new insight into the causation of PD.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the precision and accuracy of an automated method for segmenting white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on fast fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) images in elderly brains at 3T. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FLAIR images from 18 individuals (60-82 years, 9 females) with WMH burdens ranging from 1-80 cm(3) were used. The protocol included the removal of clearly hyperintense voxels; two-class fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM); and thresholding to segment probable WMH. Two false-positive minimization (FPM) methods using white matter templates were tested. Precision was assessed by adding synthetic hyperintense voxels to brain slices. Accuracy was validated by comparing automatic and manual segmentations. Whole-brain, voxel-wise metrics of similarity, under- and overestimation were used to evaluate both precision and accuracy. RESULTS: Precision was high, as the lowest accuracy in the synthetic datasets was 93{\%}. Both FPM strategies successfully improved overall accuracy. Whole-brain accuracy for the FCM segmentation alone ranged from 45{\%}-81{\%}, which improved to 75{\%}-85{\%} using the FPM strategies. CONCLUSION: The method was accurate across the range of WMH burden typically seen in the elderly. Accuracy levels achieved or exceeded those of other approaches using multispectral and/or more sophisticated pattern recognition methods.},

In this paper, a method for segmentation of multiple sclerosis lesions from magnetic resonance (MR) brain image is proposed. The proposed method combines the strengths of two existing techniques: fuzzy connectedness and artificial neural networks. From the input MR brain image, the fuzzy connectedness algorithm is used to extract segments which are parts of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white matter (WM) or gray matter (GM). Segments of the MRI image which are not extracted as part of CSF, WM or GM are processed morphologically, and features are computed for each of them. Then these computed features are fed to a trained artificial neural network, which decides whether a segment is a part of a lesion or not. The results of our method show 90{\%} correlation with the expert's manual work.},

abstract = {Background and Purpose-- It has been hypothesized that the use of different visual rating scales partly explains the discordant results of studies investigating risk factors and clinical correlates of age-related cerebral white matter changes (leukoaraiosis). We aimed to compare 6 widely used rating scales for leukoaraiosis and to calculate conversion coefficients of the score of 1 scale in the score of a second scale. Methods-- Two trained raters evaluated 80 pairs of CT and MRI scans using 2 CT and 4 MRI rating scales for white matter changes. Correlations among the scales were evaluated and regression lines were constructed with each of the CT and MRI scale scores as variables. Results-- A high correlation was observed in all the paired comparisons of the 6 scales (Spearman's {\{}rho{\}} ranging from 0.85 to 0.96, P{\textless}0.0001). Using regression analysis, we determined numeric parameters to transform the score of 1 scale to the corresponding score for each of the remaining scales and relative confidence intervals. The predictive values of these conversions expressed as R2 ranged from 0.75 to 0.92. Conclusions-- The present findings support the view that a good correlation exists among the considered visual rating scales for white matter changes.

abstract = {The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis induce the changes that underpin relapse-associated and progressive disability. Disease mechanisms can be investigated in preclinical models and patients with multiple sclerosis by molecular and metabolic imaging techniques. Many insights have been gained from such imaging studies: persisting inflammation in the absence of a damaged blood-brain barrier, activated microglia within and beyond lesions, increased mitochondrial activity after acute lesions, raised sodium concentrations in the brain, increased glutamate in acute lesions and normal-appearing white matter, different degrees of demyelination in different patients and lesions, early neuronal damage in grey matter, and early astrocytic proliferation and activation in lesions and white matter. Clinical translation of molecular and metabolic imaging and extension of these techniques will enable the assessment of novel drugs targeted at these disease mechanisms, and have the potential to improve health outcomes through the stratification of patients for treatments.},

abstract = {Differences in grading signal hyperintensities on magnetic resonance imaging may explain earlier reported conflicting results in studies of normal aging and dementia. We designed a new rating scale in which periventricular and white matter signal hyperintensities as well as basal ganglia and infratentorial signal hyperintensities are rated separately in a semiquantative way. In this study we compared the inter- and intra-observer agreements of this scale to the widely used rating scale of Fazekas. We confirmed the poor to reasonable intra- and inter-observer agreements of the Fazekas scale. The new scale, although more elaborate, provided good agreements with respect to the white matter, basal ganglia and infratentorial signal hyperintensities. In rating periventricular hyperintensities this scale yielded no advantage. It is concluded that this scale may be of use in studies especially focussing on deep white matter pathology on MRI, because it provides more detailed information, with good intra- and inter-observer reliability. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to detect lesions in the brains of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and is essential for diagnosing the disease and monitoring its progression. In practice, lesion load is often quantified by either manual or semi-automated segmentation of MRI, which is time-consuming, costly, and associated with large inter- and intra-observer variability. We propose OASIS is Automated Statistical Inference for Segmentation (OASIS), an automated statistical method for segmenting MS lesions in MRI studies. We use logistic regression models incorporating multiple MRI modalities to estimate voxel-level probabilities of lesion presence. Intensity-normalized T1-weighted, T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and proton density volumes from 131 MRI studies (98 MS subjects, 33 healthy subjects) with manual lesion segmentations were used to train and validate our model. Within this set, OASIS detected lesions with a partial area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for clinically relevant false positive rates of 1{\%} and below of 0.59{\%} (95{\%} CI; [0.50{\%}, 0.67{\%}]) at the voxel level. An experienced MS neuroradiologist compared these segmentations to those produced by LesionTOADS, an image segmentation software that provides segmentation of both lesions and normal brain structures. For lesions, OASIS out-performed LesionTOADS in 74{\%} (95{\%} CI: [65{\%}, 82{\%}]) of cases for the 98 MS subjects. To further validate the method, we applied OASIS to 169 MRI studies acquired at a separate center. The neuroradiologist again compared the OASIS segmentations to those from LesionTOADS. For lesions, OASIS ranked higher than LesionTOADS in 77{\%} (95{\%} CI: [71{\%}, 83{\%}]) of cases. For a randomly selected subset of 50 of these studies, one additional radiologist and one neurologist also scored the images. Within this set, the neuroradiologist ranked OASIS higher than LesionTOADS in 76{\%} (95{\%} CI: [64{\%}, 88{\%}]) of cases, the neurologist 66{\%} (95{\%} CI: [52{\%}, 78{\%}]) and the radiologist 52{\%} (95{\%} CI: [38{\%}, 66{\%}]). OASIS obtains the estimated probability for each voxel to be part of a lesion by weighting each imaging modality with coefficient weights. These coefficients are explicit, obtained using standard model fitting techniques, and can be reused in other imaging studies. This fully automated method allows sensitive and specific detection of lesion presence and may be rapidly applied to large collections of images. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Good CTA collaterals independently predict good outcome in acute ischemic stroke. Our aim was to evaluate the role of collateral circulation and its added benefit over CTP-derived total ischemic volume as a predictor of baseline NIHSS score, total ischemic volume, hemorrhagic transformation, final infarct size, and a modified Rankin Scale score {\textgreater}2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 395 patients with stroke dichotomized by recanalization (recanalization positive/recanalization negative) and collateral status. Clot burden score was quantified on baseline CTA. Total ischemic volumes were derived from thresholded CTP maps. Final infarct size was assessed on follow-up CT/MRI. We performed uni-/multivariate analyses for each outcome, adjusting for rtPA status, using general linear (continuous variables) and logistic (binary variables) regression. Model comparison with collateral score and total ischemic volume was performed using the F or likelihood ratio test. RESULTS: Collateral presence independently and inversely predicted all outcomes except hemorrhagic transformation in patients who were recanalization negative and mRS {\textgreater}2 in patients who were recanalization positive. The greatest collateral benefit occurred in patients who were recanalization negative, contributing 16.5{\%} and 19.2{\%} of the variability for final infarct size and mRS {\textgreater}2. The collateral score model is superior to the total ischemic volume for mRS {\textgreater}2 prediction, but a combination of total ischemic volume and collateral score is superior for mRS {\textgreater}2 and final infarct prediction (24{\%} and 28{\%} variability, respectively). In patients who were recanalization positive, a model including collateral score and total ischemic volume was superior to that of total ischemic volume for hemorrhagic transformation and final infarct prediction but was muted compared with patients who were recanalization negative (11.3{\%} and 16.9{\%} variability). CONCLUSIONS: Collateral circulation is an independent predictor of all outcomes, but the magnitude of significance varies, greater in patients who were recanalization negative versus recanalization positive. Total ischemic volume assessment is complementary to collateral score in many cases.},

@article{Weyn1998,
abstract = {In this paper, wavelets were employed for multi-scale image analysis to extract parameters for the description of chromatin texture in the cytological diagnosis and grading of invasive breast cancer. Their value was estimated by comparing the performance of co-occurrence, densitometric, and morphometric parameters in an automated K-nearest neighbor (Knn) classification scheme based on light microscopic images of isolated nuclei of paraffin-embedded tissue. This design allowed a multifaceted cytological retrospective study of which the practical value can be judged easily. Results show that wavelets perform excellently with classification scores comparable with densitometric and co-occurrence features. Moreover, because wavelets showed a high additive value with the other textural groups, this panel allowed a very profound description with higher recognition scores than previously reported (76{\%} for individual nuclei, 100{\%} for cases). Morphometric parameters performed less well and only slightly increased correct classification. The major drawback, besides image segmentation errors demanding operator supervision, emanated to be the few false-negative cases, which restrict the immediate practical use. However, an enlargement of the parameter set may avoid this misclassification, resulting in an applicable expert system of practical use.},

Tissue segmentation is performed by partitionning the volume into subvolumes where local MRFs are estimated in cooperation with their neighbors to ensure consistency. Local estimation fits precisely to the local intensity distribution and thus handles nonuniformity of intensity without any bias field modelization. Structure segmentation is performed via local MRFs that integrate localization constraints provided by a priori general fuzzy description of brain anatomy. Structure segmentation is not reduced to a postprocessing step but cooperates with tissue segmentation to gradually and conjointly improve models accuracy. The evaluation was performed using phantoms and real 3T brain scans. It shows good results and in particular robustness to nonuniformity and noise with a low computational cost.},

The procedure is relatively straightforward and involves spatially normalizing high-resolution images from all the subjects in the study into the same stereotactic space. This is followed by segmenting the gray matter from the spatially normalized images and smoothing the gray-matter segments. Voxel-wise parametric statistical tests which compare the smoothed gray-matter images from the two groups are performed. Corrections for multiple comparisons are made using the theory of Gaussian random fields. This paper describes the steps involved in VBM, with particular emphasis on segmenting gray matter from MR images with nonuniformity artifact. We provide evaluations of the assumptions that underpin the method, including the accuracy of the segmentation and the assumptions made about the statistical distribution of the data.},

Although it is integral to clinical and research activities, histopathologic recognition remains a time-consuming, subjective process to which only limited statistical confidence can be assigned because of inherent operator variability. Although immunohistochemical approaches allow limited molecular detection, significant challenges remain in using them for quantitative, automated pathology. Vibrational spectroscopic approaches, by contrast, directly provide nonperturbing molecular descriptors, but a practical spectroscopic protocol for histopathology is lacking. Here we couple high-throughput Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic imaging of tissue microarrays with statistical pattern recognition of spectra indicative of endogenous molecular composition and demonstrate histopathologic characterization of prostatic tissue. This automated histologic segmentation is applied to routine archival tissue samples, incorporates well-defined tests of statistical significance and eliminates any requirement for dyes or molecular probes. Finally, we differentiate benign from malignant prostatic epithelium by spectroscopic analyses.},

abstract = {Recently, there has been a rapid growth in the use of 3D multi-modal correlative imaging for studies of the human brain. Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes indicate brain areas involved in stimulus processing. These focal changes are often too small ({\&}lt;10{\%}) to be discerned from a single subject and the experiment is repeated in a series of individuals. To investigate the extent of residual variability the authors have collected over 300 MRI volumetric datasets from normal individuals and transformed these datasets into stereotaxic space using a 3D linear re-sampling algorithm. The authors then generated a series of statistical measures which express this population nonlinear variability in the form of parametric volumes, e.g. mean intensity, intensity variance. A model for anatomical variability, expressed as the width of a Gaussian blurring kernel applied to an ideal single subject, was developed and tested against the observed data},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a fully automatic brain tumor segmentation method based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The proposed networks are tailored to glioblastomas (both low and high grade) pictured in MR images. By their very nature, these tumors can appear anywhere in the brain and have almost any kind of shape, size, and contrast. These reasons motivate our exploration of a machine learning solution that exploits a flexible, high capacity DNN while being extremely efficient. Here, we give a description of different model choices that we've found to be necessary for obtaining competitive performance. We explore in particular different architectures based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), i.e. DNNs specifically adapted to image data. We present a novel CNN architecture which differs from those traditionally used in computer vision. Our CNN exploits both local features as well as more global contextual features simultaneously. Also, different from most traditional uses of CNNs, our networks use a final layer that is a convolutional implementation of a fully connected layer which allows a 40 fold speed up. We also describe a 2-phase training procedure that allows us to tackle difficulties related to the imbalance of tumor labels. Finally, we explore a cascade architecture in which the output of a basic CNN is treated as an additional source of information for a subsequent CNN. Results reported on the 2013 BRATS test dataset reveal that our architecture improves over the currently published state-of-the-art while being over 30 times faster.},

abstract = {In a glycation reaction, alpha-dicarbonyl compounds such as deoxyglucosone, methylglyoxal, and glyoxal are more reactive than the parent sugars with respect to their ability to react with amino groups of proteins to form inter- and intramolecular cross-links of proteins, stable end products called advanced Maillard products or advanced end products (AGEs). The AGEs, which are irreversibly formed, accumulate with aging, atherosclerosis, and diabetes mellitus, and are especially associated with long-lived proteins such as collagens, lens crystallins, and nerve proteins. It was suggested that the formation of AGEs not only modifies protein properites but also induces biological damage in vivo. In this report, we summerize results obtained from our studies for (1) identifying the structure of the cross-linked radical species formed in the model system-the reaction between alpha-dicarbonyl methylglyoxal with amino acids, and (2) the reactivity of the radical center of the protein created by the similar reaction. These results indicate that glycation of protein generates active centers for catalyzing one-electron oxidation-reduction reactions. This active center, which exhibits enzyme-like character, is suggested to be the cross-linked Schiff-based radical cation of the protein. It mimics the characteristics of the metal-catalyzed oxidation system. These results together indicate that glycated proteins accumulated in vivo provide stable active sites for catalyzing the formation of free redicals.},

abstract = {: Periventricular hyperintensity was identified using long repetition and echo times in spin-echo magnetic resonance imaging of patients with white-matter disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis) caused by local demyelination and in hydrocephalic patients caused by transependymal migration of spinal fluid. A review of 365 consecutives studies revealed that some degree of periventricular hyperintensity is present in most patients (93.5{\%}) regardless of diagnosis. Mild periventricular hyperintensity was seen in patients with no other evidence of intracranial pathology. Periventricular hyperintensity is a normal finding that should not be considered indicative of either demyelinating disease or hydrocephalus. More extensive and severe periventricular hyperintensity is associated with intracerebral pathology, but the finding often is nonspecific. For example, mild periventricular edema from hydrocephalus is impossible to differentiate from the increased periventricular hyperintensity seen in patients with multiple white-matter lesions. Thus, the pattern of periventricular hyperintensity has proven to be of limited value in the clinical assessment of hydrocephalic patients.},

abstract = {In Multiple Sclerosis (MS), detection of T2-hyperintense white matter (WM) lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a crucial criterion for diagnosis and predicting prognosis in early disease. Automated lesion detection is not only desirable with regard to time and cost effectiveness but also constitutes a prerequisite to minimize user bias. Here, we developed and evaluated an algorithm for automated lesion detection requiring a three-dimensional (3D) gradient echo (GRE) T1-weighted and a FLAIR image at 3 Tesla (T). Our tool determines the three tissue classes of gray matter (GM) and WM as well as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the T1-weighted image, and, then, the FLAIR intensity distribution of each tissue class in order to detect outliers, which are interpreted as lesion beliefs. Next, a conservative lesion belief is expanded toward a liberal lesion belief. To this end, neighboring voxels are analyzed and assigned to lesions under certain conditions. This is done iteratively until no further voxels are assigned to lesions. Herein, the likelihood of belonging to WM or GM is weighed against the likelihood of belonging to lesions. We evaluated our algorithm in 53 MS patients with different lesion volumes, in 10 patients with posterior fossa lesions, and 18 control subjects that were all scanned at the same 3T scanner (Achieva, Philips, Netherlands). We found good agreement with lesions determined by manual tracing (R2 values of over 0.93 independent of FLAIR slice thickness up to 6mm). These results require validation with data from other protocols based on a conventional FLAIR sequence and a 3D GRE T1-weighted sequence. Yet, we believe that our tool allows fast and reliable segmentation of FLAIR-hyperintense lesions, which might simplify the quantification of lesions in basic research and even clinical trials.},

abstract = {Acute ischemic stroke is a leading cause of adult disability worldwide. Modern endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke is predicated on advanced imaging modalities and the identification of salvageable tissue. Unlike noncontrast computed tomographic (CT) imaging or traditional magnetic resonance imaging, CT perfusion (CTP) imaging offers an active view of cerebrovascular physiology with multiple parameters involved. Though limited by the different equipment and analytic software used to quantitatively assess the extent of ischemia and penumbra, CTP imaging nevertheless serves as an excellent tool for neurointerventionists. The rapidity by which CT perfusion may be obtained coupled with its potential for predicting infarct can lead to faster intervention times. Although each imaging modality offers its own set of advantages and disadvantages, we find from our experience that CTP utilized in conjunction with a clinical examination leads to an effective model for identifying patients suitable for endovascular intervention.},

abstract = {Uncontrolled proliferation is a hallmark of cancer. In breast cancer, immunohistochemical assessment of the proportion of cells staining for the nuclear antigen Ki67 has become the most widely used method for comparing proliferation between tumor samples. Potential uses include prognosis, prediction of relative responsiveness or resistance to chemotherapy or endocrine therapy, estimation of residual risk in patients on standard therapy and as a dynamic biomarker of treatment efficacy in samples taken before, during, and after neoadjuvant therapy, particularly neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. Increasingly, Ki67 is measured in these scenarios for clinical research, including as a primary efficacy endpoint for clinical trials, and sometimes for clinical management. At present, the enormous variation in analytical practice markedly limits the value of Ki67 in each of these contexts. On March 12, 2010, an international panel of investigators with substantial expertise in the assessment of Ki67 and in the development of biomarker guidelines was convened in London by the co-chairs of the Breast International Group and North American Breast Cancer Group Biomarker Working Party to consider evidence for potential applications. Comprehensive recommendations on preanalytical and analytical assessment, and interpretation and scoring of Ki67 were formulated based on current evidence. These recommendations are geared toward achieving a harmonized methodology, create greater between-laboratory and between-study comparability, and allow earlier valid applications of this marker in clinical practice.},

abstract = {Semi-quantitative grading and scoring systems are used by pathologists to describe metastatic potential and the likelihood of response to therapy. Unfortunately, the visual review of tissue slides is a subjective process, creating variability in the grade or score. Moreover, in many cases, performing manual measurements is laborious, especially if a large number of high-power fields is required. To combat these challenges, image analysis can be used to automatically analyze and quantify disease in digital pathology images. Such developments offer objective, quantitative, reliable, and efficient measures that can improve concordance rates among pathologists, resulting in better patient management. Also, because of the automated nature of such systems, image analysis can be exploited in large-scale research studies for drug discovery or to analyze therapeutic response.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We investigated whether computed tomography (CT) perfusion-derived cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) could be used to differentiate between penumbra and infarcted gray matter in a limited, exploratory sample of acute stroke patients. METHODS: Thirty patients underwent a noncontrast CT (NCCT), CT angiography (CTA), and CT perfusion (CTP) scan within 7 hours of stroke onset, NCCT and CTA at 24 hours, and NCCT at 5 to 7 days. Twenty-five patients met the criteria for inclusion and were subsequently divided into 2 groups: those with recanalization at 24 hours (n=16) and those without (n=9). Penumbra was operationally defined as tissue with an admission CBF {\textless}25 mL x 100 g(-1) x min(-1) that was not infarcted on the 5- to 7-day NCCT. Logistic regression was applied to differentiate between infarct and penumbra data points. RESULTS: For recanalized patients, CBF was significantly lower (P{\textless}0.05) for infarct (13.3+/-3.75 mL x 100 g(-1) x min(-1)) than penumbra (25.0+/-3.82 mL x 100 g(-1) x min(-1)). CBV in the penumbra (2.15+/-0.43 mL x 100 g(-1)) was significantly higher than contralateral (1.78+/-0.30 mL x 100 g(-1)) and infarcted tissue (1.12+/-0.37 mL x 100 g(-1)). Logistic regression using an interaction term (CBFxCBV) resulted in sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 97.0{\%}, 97.2{\%}, and 97.1{\%}, respectively. The interaction term resulted in a significantly better (P{\textless}0.05) fit than CBF or CBV alone, suggesting that the CBV threshold for infarction varies with CBF. For patients without recanalization, CBF and CBV for infarcted regions were 15.1+/-5.67 mL x 100 g(-1) x min(-1) and 1.17+/-0.41 mL x 100 g(-1), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown in a limited sample of patients that CBF and CBV obtained from CTP can be sensitive and specific for infarction and should be investigated further in a prospective trial to assess their utility for differentiating between infarct and penumbra.},

Consequently, there is a critical need for more-effective methods of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of the complications of atherosclerosis. Careful and well-conducted large population studies are needed in order to truly understand the natural history of the disease, its imaging biomarkers, and their links to patient outcomes. The Canadian Atherosclerosis Imaging Network (CAIN) is a unique research network funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Canada Foundation for Innovation and designed to address these needs and to enable large population-based imaging studies. The central objective of CAIN is to move innovations in imaging toward their broad application in clinical research and clinical practice for the improved evaluation of cardiac and neurologic vascular disease. CAIN is established as an international resource for studying the natural history, progression, and regression of atherosclerosis, as well as novel therapeutic interventions aimed at atherosclerosis. The network represents Canada's leading atherosclerosis imaging experts, embodying both basic imaging science and clinical imaging research. The network is improving methods of detection and treatment of atherosclerosis and, through a better understanding of the underlying disease itself, improving strategies for disease prevention. The benefits are expected to appear in the next 2 to 3 years. CAIN will drive innovation in imaging technology within the field of cardiology and neurology and improve health outcomes in Canada and worldwide.},

abstract = {Although normalization of brain images is critical to the analysis of structural damage across individuals, loss of tissue due to focal lesions presents challenges to the available normalization algorithms. Until recently, cost function masking, as advocated by Brett and colleagues (2001), was the accepted method to overcome difficulties encountered when normalizing damaged brains; however, development of the unified segmentation approach for normalization in SPM5 (Ashburner {\&} Friston, 2005) offered an alternative. Crinion et al. (2007) demonstrated this approach produced normalization results without cost function masking that appeared to be robust to lesion effects when tested using the same simulated lesions studied by Brett et al. (2001). The present study sought to confirm the validity of this approach in brains with focal damage due to vascular events. To do so, we examined outcomes of normalization using unified segmentation with and without cost function masking in 49 brain images with chronic stroke. Lesion masks were created using two approaches (precise and rough drawings of lesion boundaries), and normalization was implemented with both smoothed and unsmoothed versions of the masks. We found that failure to employ cost function masking produced less accurate results in real and simulated lesions, compared to masked normalization, both in terms of deformation field displacement and voxelwise intensity differences. Additionally, unmasked normalization led to significant underestimation of lesion volume relative to all four masking conditions, especially in patients with large lesions. Taken together, these findings suggest cost function masking is still necessary when normalizing brain images with chronic infarcts. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Many patch-based image denoising algorithms can be formulated as applying a smoothing filter to the noisy image. Expressed as matrices, the smoothing filters must be row normalized so that each row sums to unity. Surprisingly, if we apply a column normalization before the row normalization, the performance of the smoothing filter can often be significantly improved. Prior works showed that such performance gain is related to the Sinkhorn-Knopp balancing algorithm, an iterative procedure that symmetrizes a row-stochastic matrix to a doubly-stochastic matrix. However, a complete understanding of the performance gain phenomenon is still lacking.   In this paper, we study the performance gain phenomenon from a statistical learning perspective. We show that Sinkhorn-Knopp is equivalent to an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm of learning a Product of Gaussians (PoG) prior of the image patches. By establishing the correspondence between the steps of Sinkhorn-Knopp and the EM algorithm, we provide a geometrical interpretation of the symmetrization process. The new PoG model also allows us to develop a new denoising algorithm called Product of Gaussian Non-Local-Means (PoG-NLM). PoG-NLM is an extension of the Sinkhorn-Knopp and is a generalization of the classical non-local means. Despite its simple formulation, PoG-NLM outperforms many existing smoothing filters and has a similar performance compared to BM3D.},

T1-weighted, mixed (T1, proton density, and T2), and T2-weighted MR pulse sequences were used. More than 20 lesions in each of 14 patients were demonstrated by pre-Gd mixed images and T2WI. Nine patients had clinical symptoms of active disease. Gd-enhanced T1WI showed at least one lesion that appeared to correspond with newly reported symptoms or signs. In addition, three clinically stable patients showed enhancement. Enhancement was best seen on 3-minute T1WI. HICT scans showed enhancement in four of the nine patients with active disease and in none of five clinically stable patients. Gd-enhanced MR imaging appears to be more sensitive than HICT in the detection of the transient abnormalities of the blood-brain barrier that occur in patients with active MS and appears capable of distinguishing active lesions that may correspond to the anatomic regions responsible for abnormal clinical findings.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging often detects abnormalities whose significance is unknown. The prevalence and correlates of findings such as ventricular enlargement, sulcal widening, and increased white matter signal intensity were examined in 303 men and women aged 65 to 95 years participating in a multicenter study of cardiovascular disease. METHODS: Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging was performed and interpreted according to a standard protocol, and findings were correlated with measures of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors. RESULTS: Measures of cerebral atrophy increased with age and were greater in men than in women (each P {\textless} .01). Ventricular enlargement and sulcal widening were associated with prior stroke, hypertension, diabetes, and white race (each P {\textless} .03). Extent of white matter hyperintensity was associated with age, prior stroke, hypertension, and use of diuretics (each P {\textless} .004). On multivariate analysis, age, male gender, white race, and prior stroke retained strong associations with increased ventricular and sulcal scores. After adjustment for age, prior stroke, and other risk factors, white matter hyperintensity was associated with atherosclerosis as measured by increased internal carotid artery thickness on ultrasound. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral atrophy and white matter hyperintensity are common in the elderly and are associated with age, prior stroke, and known cardiovascular risk factors. Though these findings have been suggested to represent normal aging, their wide variability and associations with cardiovascular disease argue against their inevitability with advancing age and support the need to identify modifiable risk factors for these abnormalities.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To characterize the spatial pattern of cerebral ischemic vulnerability to hypoperfusion in stroke patients. METHODS: We included 90 patients who underwent admission CT perfusion and MRI within 12 hours of ischemic stroke onset. Infarcted brain lesions ("core") were segmented from admission diffusion-weighted imaging and, along with the CT perfusion parameter maps, coregistered onto MNI-152 brain space, which was parcellated into 125 mirror cortical and subcortical regions per hemisphere. We tested the hypothesis that the percent infarction increment per unit of relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) reduction differs statistically between regions using regression analysis to assess the interaction between regional rCBF and region variables. Next, for each patient, a "vulnerability index" map was constructed with voxel values equaling the product of that voxel's rCBF and infarction probability (derived from the MNI-152-transformed, binary, segmented, diffusion-weighted imaging lesions). Voxel-based rCBF threshold for core was determined within the upper 20th percentile of vulnerability index map voxel values. RESULTS: Different regions had different percent infarction increase per unit rCBF reduction (P=0.001). The caudate body, putamen, insular ribbon, paracentral lobule, and precentral, middle, and inferior frontal gyri had the highest ischemic vulnerability to hypoperfusion. A voxel-based rCBF threshold of {\textless}0.42 optimally distinguished infarct core in the highly-vulnerable regions, whereas rCBF{\textless}0.16 distinguished core in the remainder of the brain. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated regional ischemic vulnerability of the brain to hypoperfusion in acute stroke patients. Location-specific, rather than whole-brain, rCBF thresholds may provide a more accurate metric for estimating infarct core using CT perfusion maps.},

abstract = {Over the last 15 years, basic thresholding techniques in combination with standard statistical correlation-based data analysis tools have beenwidely used to investigate different aspects of evolution of acute or subacute to late stage ischemic stroke in both human and animal data. Yet, awave of biology-dependent and imaging-dependent issues is still untackled pointing towards the key question: "how does an ischemic stroke evolve?" Paving the way for potential answers to this question, bothmagnetic resonance (MRI) and CT (computed tomography) images have been used to visualize the lesion extent, either with or without spatial distinction between dead and salvageable tissue. Combining diffusion and perfusion imaging modalities may provide the possibility of predicting further tissue recovery or eventual necrosis. Going beyond these basic thresholding techniques, in this critical appraisal, we explore different semi-automatic or fully automatic 2D/3D medical image analysis methods and mathematical models applied to human, animal (rats/rodents) and/or synthetic ischemic stroke to tackle one of the following three problems: (1) segmentation of infarcted and/or salvageable (also called penumbral) tissue, (2) prediction of final ischemic tissue fate (death or recovery) and (3) dynamic simulation of the lesion core and/or penumbra evolution. To highlight the key features in the reviewed segmentation and prediction methods, we propose a common categorization pattern. We also emphasize some key aspects of the methods such as the imaging modalities required to build and test the presented approach, the number of patients/animals or synthetic samples, the use of external user interaction and the methods of assessment (clinical or imaging-based). Furthermore, we investigate how any key difficulties, posed by the evolution of stroke such as swelling or reperfusion, were detected (or not) by eachmethod. In the absence of any imaging-based macroscopic dynamicmodel applied to ischemic stroke, we have insights into relevant microscopic dynamic models simulating the evolution of brain ischemia in the hope to further promising and challenging 4D imaging-based dynamic models. By depicting the major pitfalls and the advanced aspects of the different reviewed methods, we present an overall critique of their performances and concluded our discussion by suggesting some recommendations for future research work focusing on one or more of the three addressed problems. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {Age-related white matter changes (WMC) are thought to be a marker of vascular pathology, and have been associated with motor and cognitive deficits. In the present study, an optimized artificial neural network was used as an automatic segmentation method to produce probabilistic maps of WMC in a clinical multi-center study. The neural network uses information from T1- and T2-weighted and fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance (MR) scans, neighboring voxels and spatial location. Generalizability of the neural network was optimized by including the Optimal Brain Damage (OBD) pruning method in the training stage. Six optimized neural networks were produced to investigate the impact of different input information on WMC segmentation. The automatic segmentation method was applied to MR scans of 362 non-demented elderly subjects from 11 centers in the European multi-center study Leukoaraiosis And Disability (LADIS). Semi-manually delineated WMC were used for validating the segmentation produced by the neural networks. The neural network segmentation demonstrated high consistency between subjects and centers, making it a promising technique for large studies. For WMC volumes less than 10 ml, an increasing discrepancy between semi-manual and neural network segmentation was observed using the similarity index (SI) measure. The use of all three image modalities significantly improved cross-center generalizability compared to neural networks using the FLAIR image only. Expert knowledge not available to the neural networks was a minor source of discrepancy, while variation in MR scan quality constituted the largest source of error.},

A pre-processing step is needed to correct for the bias field signal before submitting corrupted MRI images to such algorithms or the algorithms should be modified. In this report we discuss two approaches to deal with bias field corruption. The first approach can be used as a preprocessing step where the corrupted MRI image is restored by dividing it by an estimated bias field signal using a surface fitting approach. The second approach shows how to modify the fuzzy c-means algorithm so that it can be used to segment an MRI image corrupted by a bias field signal.},

abstract = {Subcortical and periventricular white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) may have different associations with cognition and pathophysiology. The aim of the present study is to develop an automated method for construction of periventricular WMH maps that enables the analysis of between-group differences in WMH location and characteristics in the periventricular region without the requirement of prior boundary definition. To avoid influence of WMHs on spatial normalization, a reference image of the lateral ventricles was constructed based on images of 24 subjects. Construction was not biased to a single subject. WMHs were segmented by k-nearest neighbor-based classification of magnetic resonance inversion recovery and fluid attenuated inversion recovery images. Cerebrospinal fluid segmentations of individual subjects were nonrigidly mapped to the reference image of the lateral ventricles. The subject's WMHs were transformed to the reference space accordingly. Spatial normalization accuracy was validated using measures of overlap and of displacement relative to the boundary of the lateral ventricles. After spatial normalization, the boundaries of the lateral ventricles closely matched the reference image and in an area of approximately 1 cm around the lateral ventricles the relative displacement was less than 1 mm. To illustrate the method, it was applied to 61 patients with Type 2 diabetes and 26 control subjects, whereupon periventricular WMH maps were constructed and compared. The proposed method is particularly suited to analyze WMH distribution differences at the level of the lateral ventricles between large groups of patients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), a subtype of stroke associated with high mortality and disability, accounts for 13{\%} of all strokes. Basic and clinical research has contributed to our understanding of the complex pathophysiology of neuronal injury in ICH. Outcome rates, however, remain stable, and questions regarding acute management of ICH remain unanswered. Newer research is aiming at matching measured levels of serum proteins, enzymes, or cells to different stages of brain damage, suggesting that blood biomarkers may assist in acute diagnosis, therapeutic decisions, and prognostication. This paper provides an overview on the most promising blood biomarkers and their potential role in the diagnosis and management of spontaneous ICH.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUMMARY: Information was collected from studies, reviews, and guidelines listed in PubMed up to November 2013 on blood biomarkers of nontraumatic ICH in humans. We describe the potential role and limitations of GFAP, S100B/RAGE, and ApoC-III as diagnostic biomarkers, $\beta$-​Amyloid as a biomarker for etiological classification, and 27 biomarkers for prognosis of mortality and functional outcome. Within the group of prognostic markers we discuss markers involved in coagulation processes (e.g., D-Dimers), neuroendocrine markers (e.g., copeptin), systemic metabolic markers (e.g., blood glucose levels), markers of inflammation (e.g., IL-6), as well as growth factors (e.g., VEGF), and others (e.g., glutamate). Some of those blood biomarkers are agents of pathologic processes associated with hemorrhagic stroke but also other diseases, whereas others play more distinct pathophysiological roles and help in understanding the basic mechanisms of brain damage and/or recovery in ICH.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nKEY MESSAGES: Numerous blood biomarkers are associated with different pathophysiological pathways in ICH, and some of them promise to be useful in the management of ICH, eventually contributing additional information to current tools for diagnosis, therapy monitoring, risk stratification, or intervention. Up to date, however, no blood biomarker of ICH has been studied sufficiently to find its way into clinical routine yet; well-designed, large-scale, clinical studies addressing relevant clinical questions are needed. We suggest that the effectiveness of biomarker research in ICH might be improved by international cooperation and shared resources for large validation studies, such as provided by the consortium on stroke biomarker research (http://stroke-biomarkers.​com/page.php?title=Resources).},

abstract = {Although a wide range of approaches have been developed to automatically assess the volume of brain regions from MRI, the reproducibility of these algorithms across different scanners and pulse sequences, their accuracy in different clinical populations and sensitivity to real changes in brain volume have not always been comprehensively examined. Firstly we present a comprehensive testing protocol which comprises 312 freely available MR images to assess the accuracy, reproducibility and sensitivity of automated brain segmentation techniques. Accuracy is assessed in infants, young adults and patients with Alzheimer's disease in comparison to gold standard measures by expert observers using a manual technique based on Cavalieri's principle. The protocol determines the reliability of segmentation between scanning sessions, different MRI pulse sequences and 1.5T and 3T field strengths and examines their sensitivity to small changes in volume using a large longitudinal dataset. Secondly we apply this testing protocol to a novel algorithm for segmenting the lateral ventricles and compare its performance to the widely used FSL FIRST and FreeSurfer methods. The testing protocol produced quantitative measures of accuracy, reliability and sensitivity of lateral ventricle volume estimates for each segmentation method. The novel algorithm showed high accuracy in all populations (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC{\textgreater}0.95), good reproducibility between MRI pulse sequences (ICC{\textgreater}0.99) and was sensitive to age related changes in longitudinal data. FreeSurfer demonstrated high accuracy (ICC{\textgreater}0.95), good reproducibility (ICC{\textgreater}0.99) and sensitivity whilst FSL FIRST showed good accuracy in young adults and infants (ICC{\textgreater}0.90) and good reproducibility (ICC=0.98), but was unable to segment ventricular volume in patients with Alzheimer's disease or healthy subjects with large ventricles. Using the same computer system, the novel algorithm and FSL FIRST processed a single MRI image in less than 10min while FreeSurfer took approximately 7h. The testing protocol presented enables the accuracy, reproducibility and sensitivity of different algorithms to be compared.

abstract = {Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with varied morphological appearances, molecular features, behavior, and response to therapy. Current routine clinical management of breast cancer relies on the availability of robust clinical and pathological prognostic and predictive factors to support clinical and patient decision making in which potentially suitable treatment options are increasingly available. One of the best-established prognostic factors in breast cancer is histological grade, which represents the morphological assessment of tumor biological characteristics and has been shown to be able to generate important information related to the clinical behavior of breast cancers. Genome-wide microarray-based expression profiling studies have unraveled several characteristics of breast cancer biology and have provided further evidence that the biological features captured by histological grade are important in determining tumor behavior. Also, expression profiling studies have generated clinically useful data that have significantly improved our understanding of the biology of breast cancer, and these studies are undergoing evaluation as improved prognostic and predictive tools in clinical practice. Clinical acceptance of these molecular assays will require them to be more than expensive surrogates of established traditional factors such as histological grade. It is essential that they provide additional prognostic or predictive information above and beyond that offered by current parameters. Here, we present an analysis of the validity of histological grade as a prognostic factor and a consensus view on the significance of histological grade and its role in breast cancer classification and staging systems in this era of emerging clinical use of molecular classifiers.},

abstract = {White matter hyperintensities (WMH) on T2 or FLAIR sequences have been commonly observed on MR images of elderly people. They have been associated with various disorders and have been shown to be a strong risk factor for stroke and dementia. WMH studies usually required visual evaluation of WMH load or time-consuming manual delineation. This paper introduced WHASA (White matter Hyperintensities Automated Segmentation Algorithm), a new method for automatically segmenting WMH from FLAIR and T1 images in multicentre studies. Contrary to previous approaches that were based on intensities, this method relied on contrast: non linear diffusion filtering alternated with watershed segmentation to obtain piecewise constant images with increased contrast between WMH and surroundings tissues. WMH were then selected based on subject dependant automatically computed threshold and anatomical information. WHASA was evaluated on 67 patients from two studies, acquired on six different MRI scanners and displaying a wide range of lesion load. Accuracy of the segmentation was assessed through volume and spatial agreement measures with respect to manual segmentation; an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.96 and a mean similarity index (SI) of 0.72 were obtained. WHASA was compared to four other approaches: Freesurfer and a thresholding approach as unsupervised methods; k-nearest neighbours (kNN) and support vector machines (SVM) as supervised ones. For these latter, influence of the training set was also investigated. WHASA clearly outperformed both unsupervised methods, while performing at least as good as supervised approaches (ICC range: 0.87-0.91 for kNN; 0.89-0.94 for SVM. Mean SI: 0.63-0.71 for kNN, 0.67-0.72 for SVM), and did not need any training set.},

Regions were identified on high-resolution anatomical scans using a combination of manual and automatic methods. Only voxels identified as pure tissue at the resolution of the quantitative scans were considered for analysis. While no left/right differences were observed, significant differences were found among white-matter regions and gray-matter regions. These regional differences were compared with existing cytoarchitectural data. In addition, the pattern and magnitude of the regional differences observed in white matter was found to be different from that reported previously for an alternative putative MRI measure of myelination, the 10-50-ms T2 component described as myelin water.},

abstract = {Mutations in DJ-1 cause recessively transmitted early-onset Parkinson disease (PD), and oxidative damage to DJ-1 has been associated with the pathogenesis of late-onset sporadic PD. The precise biochemical function of DJ-1 remains elusive. Here, we report that DJ-1 is synthesized as a latent protease zymogen with low-intrinsic proteolytic activity. DJ-1 protease zymogen is activated by the removal of a 15-amino acid peptide at its C terminus. The activated DJ-1 functions as a cysteine protease with Cys-106 and His-126 as the catalytic diad. We show that endogenous DJ-1 in dopaminergic cells undergoes C-terminal cleavage in response to mild oxidative stress, suggesting that DJ-1 protease activation occurs in a redox-dependent manner. Moreover, we find that the C-terminally cleaved form of DJ-1 with activated protease function exhibits enhanced cytoprotective action against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. The cytoprotective action of DJ-1 is abolished by the C106A and H126A mutations. Our findings support a role for DJ-1 protease in cellular defense against oxidative stress and have important implications for understanding and treating PD.},

abstract = {The term cerebral small vessel disease refers to a group of pathological processes with various aetiologies that affect the small arteries, arterioles, venules, and capillaries of the brain. Age-related and hypertension-related small vessel diseases and cerebral amyloid angiopathy are the most common forms. The consequences of small vessel disease on the brain parenchyma are mainly lesions located in the subcortical structures such as lacunar infarcts, white matter lesions, large haemorrhages, and microbleeds. Because lacunar infarcts and white matter lesions are easily detected by neuroimaging, whereas small vessels are not, the term small vessel disease is frequently used to describe the parenchyma lesions rather than the underlying small vessel alterations. This classification, however, restricts the definition of small vessel disease to ischaemic lesions and might be misleading. Small vessel disease has an important role in cerebrovascular disease and is a leading cause of cognitive decline and functional loss in the elderly. Small vessel disease should be a main target for preventive and treatment strategies, but all types of presentation and complications should be taken into account.},

@article{Stevenson2000,
abstract = {Objective: To investigate the variation in T1 and T2 relaxation times of normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) throughout the brain. Background: The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence fast FLAIR (fluid attenuated inversion recovery) has demonstrated overall increased lesion detection when compared to conventional or fast spin echo (FSE) but fewer lesions in the posterior fossa and spinal cord. The reasons for this are unknown, but may be due to variations in the T1 and T2 relaxation times within NAWM and MS lesions. Method: Ten patients and 10 controls underwent MRI of the brain which involved FSE, fast FLAIR and the measurement of T1 and T2 relaxation times. Results: Of 151 lesions analysed (22 infra-tentorial, 129 supra-tentorial), eight were missed by the fast FLAIR sequence. T1 and T2 relaxation times in normal controls were longer in the infra-tentorial, than supra-tentorial, region. Patient NAWM relaxation times were prolonged compared with control values in both regions. Lesions demonstrated longer relaxation times than either control white matter or patient NAWM in both regions, however this difference was less marked infra-tentorially. The eight posterior fossa lesions not visible on the fast FLAIR sequence were characterised by short T1 and T2 relaxation times which overlapped with the patient NAWM for both T1 and T2 and with control values for T2 relaxation times. Conclusion: Both lesion and NAWM relaxation time characteristics vary throughout the brain. The TI and T2 relaxation times of infra-tentorial lesions are closer to the relaxation times of local NAWM than supra-tentorial lesions, resulting in reduced contrast between posterior fossa lesions and the background NAWM. Consequently the characteristics of some lesions overlap with those of NAWM resulting in reduced conspicuity. By utilising this information, it may be possible to optimise fast FLAIR sequences to improve infra-tentorial lesion detection. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is often used to characterize and quantify multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions in the brain and spinal cord. The number and volume of lesions have been used to evaluate MS disease burden, to track the progression of the disease and to evaluate the effect of new pharmaceuticals in clinical trials. Accurate identification of MS lesions in MR images is extremely difficult due to variability in lesion location, size and shape in addition to anatomical variability between subjects. Since manual segmentation requires expert knowledge, is time consuming and is subject to intra- and inter-expert variability, many methods have been proposed to automatically segment lesions. The objective of this study was to carry out a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the state of the art in automated multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation. From 1240 hits found initially with PubMed and Google scholar, our selection criteria identified 80 papers that described an automatic lesion segmentation procedure applied to MS. Only 47 of these included quantitative validation with at least one realistic image. In this paper, we describe the complexity of lesion segmentation, classify the automatic MS lesion segmentation methods found, and review the validation methods applied in each of the papers reviewed. Although many segmentation solutions have been proposed, including some with promising results using MRI data obtained on small groups of patients, no single method is widely employed due to performance issues related to the high variability of MS lesion appearance and differences in image acquisition. The challenge remains to provide segmentation techniques that work in all cases regardless of the type of MS, duration of the disease, or MRI protocol, and this within a comprehensive, standardized validation framework. MS lesion segmentation remains an open problem.},

abstract = {Cerebral white matter lesions (WMLs) have been associated with cognitive dysfunction. Whether periventricular or subcortical WMLs relate differently to cognitive function is still uncertain. In addition, it is unclear whether WMLs are related to specific cognitive domains such as memory or psychomotor speed. We examined the relationship between periventricular and subcortical WMLs and cognitive functioning in 1,077 elderly subjects randomly sampled from the general population. Quantification of WMLs was assessed by means of an extensive rating scale on 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging scans. Cognitive function was assessed by using multiple neuropsychological tests from which we constructed compound scores for psychomotor speed, memory performance, and global cognitive function. When analyzed separately, both periventricular and subcortical WMLs were related to all neuropsychological measures. When periventricular WMLs were analyzed conditional on subcortical WMLs and vice versa, the relationship between periventricular WMLs and global cognitive function remained unaltered whereas the relationship with subcortical WMLs disappeared. Subjects with most severe periventricular WMLs performed nearly 1 SD below average on tasks involving psychomotor speed, and more than 0.5 SD below average for global cognitive function. Tasks that involve speed of cognitive processes appear to be more affected by WMLs than memory tasks.},

Pathologic information obtained from the prostatectomy specimen provides important prognostic information and guides recommendations for adjuvant treatment. The current pathology protocol in most centers involves primarily qualitative assessment. In this paper, we describe and evaluate our system for automatic prostate cancer detection and grading on hematoxylin {\&} eosin-stained tissue images. Our approach is intended to address the dual challenges of large data size and the need for high-level tissue information about the locations and grades of tumors. Our system uses two stages of AdaBoost-based classification. The first provides high-level tissue component labeling of a superpixel image partitioning. The second uses the tissue component labeling to provide a classification of cancer versus noncancer, and low-grade versus high-grade cancer. We evaluated our system using 991 sub-images extracted from digital pathology images of 50 whole-mount tissue sections from 15 prostatectomy patients. We measured accuracies of 90{\%} and 85{\%} for the cancer versus noncancer and high-grade versus low-grade classification tasks, respectively. This system represents a first step toward automated cancer quantification on prostate digital histopathology imaging, which could pave the way for more accurately informed postprostatectomy patient care.},

@article{Tanner1987,
abstract = {The idea of data augmentation arises naturally in missing value problems, as exemplified by the standard ways of filling in missing cells in balanced two-way tables. Thus data augmentation refers to a scheme of augmenting the observed data so as to make it more easy to analyze. This device is used to great advantage by the EM algorithm (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977) in solving maximum likelihood problems. In situations when the likelihood cannot be approximated closely by the normal likelihood, maximum likelihood estimates and the associated standard errors cannot be relied upon to make valid inferential statements. From the Bayesian point of view, one must now calculate the posterior distribution of parameters of interest. If data augmentation can be used in the calculation of the maximum likelihood estimate, then in the same cases one ought to be able to use it in the computation of the posterior distribution. It is the purpose of this article to explain how this can be done. The basic idea is quite simple. The observed data y is augmented by the quantity z, which is referred to as the latent data. It is assumed that if y and z are both known, then the problem is straightforward to analyze, that is, the augmented data posterior p({\&}{\#}952;{\&}{\#}8739;y, z) can be calculated. But the posterior density that we want is p({\&}{\#}952; {\&}{\#}8739;y), which may be difficult to calculate directly. If, however, one can generate multiple values of z from the predictive distribution p(z {\&}{\#}8739;y) (i.e., multiple imputations of z), then p({\&}{\#}952; {\&}{\#}8739;y) can be approximately obtained as the average of p({\&}{\#}952;{\&}{\#}8739;y, z) over the imputed z's. However, p(z {\&}{\#}8739;y) depends, in turn, on p({\&}{\#}952; {\&}{\#}8739;y). Hence if p({\&}{\#}952; {\&}{\#}8739;y) was known, it could be used to calculate p(z {\&}{\#}8739;y). This mutual dependency between p({\&}{\#}952; {\&}{\#}8739;y) and p(z {\&}{\#}8739;y) leads to an iterative algorithm to calculate p({\&}{\#}952; {\&}{\#}8739;y). Analytically, this algorithm is essentially the method of successive substitution for solving an operator fixed point equation. We exploit this fact to prove convergence under mild regularity conditions. Typically, to implement the algorithm, one must be able to sample from two distributions, namely p({\&}{\#}952; {\&}{\#}8739;y, z) and p(z {\&}{\#}8739;{\&}{\#}952;, y). In many cases, it is straightforward to sample from either distribution. In general, though, either sampling can be difficult, just as either the E or the M step can be difficult to implement in the EM algorithm. For p({\&}{\#}952; {\&}{\#}8739;y, z) arising from parametric submodels of the multinomial, we develop a primitive but generally applicable way to approximately sample {\&}{\#}952;. The idea is first to sample from the posterior distribution of the cell probabilities and then to project to the parametric surface that is specified by the submodel, giving more weight to those observations lying closer to the surface. This procedure should cover many of the common models for categorical data. There are several examples given in this article. First, the algorithm is introduced and motivated in the context of a genetic linkage example. Second, we apply this algorithm to an example of inference from incomplete data regarding the correlation coefficient of the bivariate normal distribution. It is seen that the algorithm recovers the bimodal nature of the posterior distribution. Finally, the algorithm is used in the analysis of the traditional latent-class model as applied to data from the General Social Survey.},

abstract = {Cancer diagnosis is based on visual examination under a microscope of tissue sections from biopsies. But whereas pathologists rely on tissue stains to identify morphological features, automated tissue recognition using color is fraught with problems that stem from image intensity variations due to variations in tissue preparation, variations in spectral signatures of the stained tissue, spectral overlap and spatial aliasing in acquisition, and noise at image acquisition. We present a blind method for color decomposition of histological images. The method decouples intensity from color information and bases the decomposition only on the tissue absorption characteristics of each stain. By modeling the charge-coupled device sensor noise, we improve the method accuracy. We extend current linear decomposition methods to include stained tissues where one spectral signature cannot be separated from all combinations of the other tissues' spectral signatures. We demonstrate both qualitatively and quantitatively that our method results in more accurate decompositions than methods based on non-negative matrix factorization and independent component analysis. The result is one density map for each stained tissue type that classifies portions of pixels into the correct stained tissue allowing accurate identification of morphological features that may be linked to cancer.},

abstract = {This paper presents a validation study on statistical nonsupervised brain tissue classification techniques in magnetic resonance (MR) images. Several image models assuming different hypotheses regarding the intensity distribution model, the spatial model and the number of classes are assessed. The methods are tested on simulated data for which the classification ground truth is known. Different noise and intensity nonuniformities are added to simulate real imaging conditions. No enhancement of the image quality is considered either before or during the classification process. This way, the accuracy of the methods and their robustness against image artifacts are tested. Classification is also performed on real data where a quantitative validation compares the methods' results with an estimated ground truth from manual segmentations by experts. Validity of the various classification methods in the labeling of the image as well as in the tissue volume is estimated with different local and global measures. Results demonstrate that methods relying on both intensity and spatial information are more robust to noise and field inhomogeneities. We also demonstrate that partial volume is not perfectly modeled, even though methods that account for mixture classes outperform methods that only consider pure Gaussian classes. Finally, we show that simulated data results can also be extended to real data.},

HER2 gene amplification or HER2 protein overexpression, detected in about 20{\%} of breast carcinomas, predicts a more aggressive clinical course and determines eligibility for targeted therapy with trastuzumab. HER2 testing has become an essential part of the clinical evaluation of all breast carcinoma patients, and accurate HER2 results are critical in identifying patients who may be benefited from targeted therapy. This study investigated the concordance in the results of HER2 immunohistochemistry assays performed in 500 invasive breast carcinomas between a reference laboratory and 149 local laboratories from all geographic regions of Brazil. Our results showed an overall poor concordance (171 of 500 cases, 34.2{\%}) regarding HER2 results between local and reference laboratories, which may be related to the low-volume load of HER2 assays, inexperience with HER2 scoring system, and/or technical issues related to immunohistochemistry in local laboratories. Standardization of HER2 testing with rigorous quality control measures by local laboratories is highly recommended to avoid erroneous treatment of breast cancer patients.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This study aims to develop an automatic segmentation framework on the basis of extreme value distribution (EVD) for the detection and volumetric quantification of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. METHODS: Two EVD-based segmentation methods, namely the Gumbel and Frechet segmentation, were developed to detect WMHs on FLAIR (slice thickness = 5 mm; TR/TE/TI = 11,000/120/2,800 ms; flip angle = 90 degrees ) images. Another automatic segmentation method using a trimmed likelihood estimator (TLE) was implemented for comparison with our proposed segmentation framework. The performances of the three automatic segmentation methods were evaluated by comparing with the manual segmentation method. RESULTS: The Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) of the two EVD-based segmentation methods were larger than those of the TLE-based segmentation method (Gumbel, 0.823 +/- 0.063; Frechet, 0.843 +/- 0.057; TLE, 0.817 +/- 0.068), demonstrating that the EVD-based segmentation outperformed the TLE-based segmentation. The Frechet segmentation obtained larger DSCs on patients with moderate to severe lesion loads and a comparable performance on patients with mild lesion loads, indicating that the Frechet segmentation was superior to the Gumbel segmentation. The Gumbel segmentation underestimated the lesion volumes of all patients, whereas the Frechet and TLE-based segmentation methods obtained overestimated lesion volumes (Manual, 13.71 +/- 14.02 cc; Gumbel, 12.73 +/- 13.21 cc; Frechet, 13.88 +/- 13.96 cc; TLE, 13.54 +/- 12.27 cc). Moreover, the EVD-based segmentation was demonstrated to be comparable to other state-of-the-art methods on a publicly available dataset. CONCLUSION: The proposed EVD-based segmentation framework is a promising, effective, and convenient tool for volumetric quantification and further study of WMHs in aging and dementia.},

abstract = {White matter lesions (WMLs) are small groups of dead cells that clump together in the white matter of brain. In this paper, we propose a reliable method to automatically segment WMLs. Our method uses a novel filter to enhance the intensity of WMLs. Then a feature set containing enhanced intensity, anatomical and spatial information is used to train a random forest classifier for the initial segmentation of WMLs. Following that a reliable and robust edge potential function based Markov Random Field (MRF) is proposed to obtain the final segmentation by removing false positive WMLs. Quantitative evaluation of the proposed method is performed on 24 subjects of ENVISion study. The segmentation results are validated against the manual segmentation, performed under the supervision of an expert neuroradiologist. The results show a dice similarity index of 0.76 for severe lesion load, 0.73 for moderate lesion load and 0.61 for mild lesion load. In addition to that we have compared our method with three state of the art methods on 20 subjects of Medical Image Computing and Computer Aided Intervention Society's (MICCAI's) MS lesion challenge dataset, where our method shows better segmentation accuracy compare to the state of the art methods. These results indicate that the proposed method can assist the neuroradiologists in assessing the WMLs in clinical practice.},

abstract = {A new method has been developed for fully automated segmentation of white matter lesions (WMLs) in cranial MR imaging. The algorithm uses information from T1-weighted (T1-w), inversion recovery (IR), proton density-weighted (PD), T2-weighted (T2-w) and fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) scans. It is based on the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classification technique that builds a feature space from voxel intensities and spatial information. The technique generates images representing the probability per voxel being part of a WML. By application of thresholds on these probability maps, binary segmentations can be obtained. ROC curves show that the segmentations achieve both high sensitivity and specificity. A similarity index (SI), overlap fraction (OF) and extra fraction (EF) are calculated for additional quantitative analysis of the result. The SI is also used for determination of the optimal probability threshold for generation of the binary segmentation. Using probabilistic equivalents of the SI, OF and EF, the probability maps can be evaluated directly, providing a powerful tool for comparison of different classification results. This method for automated WML segmentation reaches an accuracy that is comparable to methods for multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation and is suitable for detection of WMLs in large and longitudinal population studies.},

abstract = {Objective While many studies correlated cognitive function with changes in brain morphology in multiple sclerosis (MS), few of them used a multi-parametric approach in a single dataset so far. We thus here assessed the predictive value of different conventional and quantitative MRI-parameters both for overall and domain-specific cognitive performance in MS patients from a single center. Methods 69 patients (17 clinically isolated syndrome, 47 relapsing-remitting MS, 5 secondary-progressive MS) underwent the "Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Tests" assessing overall cognition, cognitive efficiency and memory function as well as MRI at 3 Tesla to obtain T2-lesion load (T2-LL), normalized brain volume (global brain volume loss), normalized cortical volume (NCV), normalized thalamic volume (NTV), normalized hippocampal volume (NHV), normalized caudate nuclei volume (NCNV), basal ganglia R2??? values (iron deposition) and magnetization transfer ratios (MTRs) for cortex and normal appearing brain tissue (NABT). Results Regression models including clinical, demographic variables and MRI-parameters explained 22-27{\%} of variance of overall cognition, 17-26{\%} of cognitive efficiency and 22-23{\%} of memory. NCV, T2-LL and MTR of NABT were the strongest predictors of overall cognitive function. Cognitive efficiency was best predicted by NCV, T2-LL and iron deposition in the basal ganglia. NTV was the strongest predictor for memory function and NHV was particularly related to memory function. Conclusions The predictive value of distinct MRI-parameters differs for specific domains of cognitive function, with a greater impact of cortical volume, focal and diffuse white matter abnormalities on overall cognitive function, an additional role of basal ganglia iron deposition on cognitive efficiency, and thalamic and hippocampal volume on memory function. This suggests the usefulness of using multiparametric MRI to assess (micro)structural correlates of different cognitive constructs.},

abstract = {Training a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch is difficult because it requires a large amount of labeled training data and a great deal of expertise to ensure proper convergence. A promising alternative is to fine-tune a CNN that has been pre-trained using, for instance, a large set of labeled natural images. However, the substantial differences between natural and medical images may advise against such knowledge transfer. In this paper, we seek to answer the following central question in the context of medical image analysis: Can the use of pre-trained deep CNNs with sufficient fine-tuning eliminate the need for training a deep CNN from scratch? To address this question, we considered four distinct medical imaging applications in three specialties (radiology, cardiology, and gastroenterology) involving classification, detection, and segmentation from three different imaging modalities, and investigated how the performance of deep CNNs trained from scratch compared with the pre-trained CNNs fine-tuned in a layer-wise manner. Our experiments consistently demonstrated that 1) the use of a pre-trained CNN with adequate fine-tuning outperformed or, in the worst case, performed as well as a CNN trained from scratch; 2) fine-tuned CNNs were more robust to the size of training sets than CNNs trained from scratch; 3) neither shallow tuning nor deep tuning was the optimal choice for a particular application; and 4) our layer-wise fine-tuning scheme could offer a practical way to reach the best performance for the application at hand based on the amount of available data.},

abstract = {A new approach to the problem of multimodality medical image registration is proposed, using a basic concept from information theory, mutual information (MI), or relative entropy, as a new matching criterion. The method presented in this paper applies MI to measure the statistical dependence or information redundancy between the image intensities of corresponding voxels in both images, which is assumed to be maximal if the images are geometrically aligned. Maximization of MI is a very general and powerful criterion, because no assumptions are made regarding the nature of this dependence and no limiting constraints are imposed on the image content of the modalities involved. The accuracy of the MI criterion is validated for rigid body registration of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and photon emission tomography (PET) images by comparison with the stereotactic registration solution, while robustness is evaluated with respect to implementation issues, such as interpolation and optimization, and image content, including partial overlap and image degradation. Our results demonstrate that subvoxel accuracy with respect to the stereotactic reference solution can be achieved completely automatically and without any prior segmentation, feature extraction, or other preprocessing steps which makes this method very well suited for clinical applications.},

abstract = {Machine learning algorithms frequently require careful tuning of model hyperparameters, regularization terms, and optimization parameters. Unfortunately, this tuning is often a "black art" that requires expert experience, unwritten rules of thumb, or sometimes brute-force search. Much more appealing is the idea of developing automatic approaches which can optimize the performance of a given learning algorithm to the task at hand. In this work, we consider the automatic tuning problem within the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithm's generalization performance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). The tractable posterior distribution induced by the GP leads to efficient use of the information gathered by previous experiments, enabling optimal choices about what parameters to try next. Here we show how the effects of the Gaussian process prior and the associated inference procedure can have a large impact on the success or failure of Bayesian optimization. We show that thoughtful choices can lead to results that exceed expert-level performance in tuning machine learning algorithms. We also describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. We show that these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization on a diverse set of contemporary algorithms including latent Dirichlet allocation, structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks.},

abstract = {White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) in the brain are the consequence of cerebral small vessel disease, and can easily be detected on MRI. Over the past three decades, research has shown that the presence and extent of white matter hyperintense signals on MRI are important for clinical outcome, in terms of cognitive and functional impairment. Large, longitudinal population-based and hospital-based studies have confirmed a dose-dependent relationship between WMHs and clinical outcome, and have demonstrated a causal link between large confluent WMHs and dementia and disability. Adequate differential diagnostic assessment and management is of the utmost importance in any patient, but most notably those with incipient cognitive impairment. Novel imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging might reveal subtle damage before it is visible on standard MRI. Even in Alzheimer disease, which is thought to be primarily caused by amyloid, vascular pathology, such as small vessel disease, may be of greater importance than amyloid itself in terms of influencing the disease course, especially in older individuals. Modification of risk factors for small vessel disease could be an important therapeutic goal, although evidence for effective interventions is still lacking. Here, we provide a timely Review on WMHs, including their relationship with cognitive decline and dementia.},

Twenty four CT scans and 24 MRI scans were separately judged by 11 and five observers, respectively, on the presence and severity of white matter lesions. The observers were radiologists and neurologists. For CT scans, these periventricular changes were graded according to their extent as absent, or partly involving the white matter, or extending up to the subcortical region. The MRI lesions were graded as no lesion or only a single one, multiple focal lesions, and multiple confluent lesions. The pairwise agreements of all possible combinations of observers for each scan were corrected for chance (kappa statistics; maximal agreement 1.0). The weighted kappa value, for anterior and posterior regions combined, was 0.63 for CT scans, and 0.78 for MRI scans.

@article{Zhuge2009,
abstract = {Typically, brain MR images present significant intensity variation across patients and scanners. Consequently, training a classifier on a set of images and using it subsequently for brain segmentation may yield poor results. Adaptive iterative methods usually need to be employed to account for the variations of the particular scan. These methods are complicated, difficult to implement and often involve significant computational costs. In this paper, a simple, non-iterative method is proposed for brain MR image segmentation. Two preprocessing techniques, namely intensity inhomogeneity correction, and more importantly MR image intensity standardization, used prior to segmentation, play a vital role in making the MR image intensities have a tissue-specific numeric meaning, which leads us to a very simple brain tissue segmentation strategy. Vectorial scale-based fuzzy connectedness and certain morphological operations are utilized first to generate the brain intracranial mask. The fuzzy membership value of each voxel within the intracranial mask for each brain tissue is then estimated. Finally, a maximum likelihood criterion with spatial constraints taken into account is utilized in classifying all voxels in the intracranial mask into different brain tissue groups. A set of inhomogeneity corrected and intensity standardized images is utilized as a training data set. We introduce two methods to estimate fuzzy membership values. In the first method, called SMG (for simple membership based on a gaussian model), the fuzzy membership value is estimated by fitting a multivariate Gaussian model to the intensity distribution of each brain tissue whose mean intensity vector and covariance matrix are estimated and fixed from the training data sets. The second method, called SMH (for simple membership based on a histogram), estimates fuzzy membership value directly via the intensity distribution of each brain tissue obtained from the training data sets. We present several studies to evaluate the performance of these two methods based on 10 clinical MR images of normal subjects and 10 clinical MR images of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. A quantitative comparison indicates that both methods have overall better accuracy than the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) method, and have much better efficiency than the Finite Mixture (FM) model based Expectation-Maximization (EM) method. Accuracy is similar for our methods and EM method for the normal subject data sets, but much better for our methods for the patient data sets.},

In contrast with filters that operate on the three bands of a color image separately, a bilateral filter can enforce the perceptual metric underlying the CIE-Lab color space, and smooth colors and preserve edges in a way that is tuned to human perception. Also, in contrast with standard filtering, bilateral filtering produces no phantom colors along edges in color images, and reduces phantom colors where they appear in the original image},

abstract = {This paper presents a method for detection of cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMH) based on run-time PD-, T1-, and T2-weighted structural magnetic resonance (MR) images of the brain along with labeled training examples. Unlike most prior approaches, the method is able to reliably detect WMHs in elderly brains in the absence of fluid-attenuated (FLAIR) images. Its success is due to the learning of probabilistic models of WMH spatial distribution and neighborhood dependencies from ground-truth examples of FLAIR-based WMH detections. These models are combined with a probabilistic model of the PD, T1, and T2 intensities of WMHs in a Markov Random Field (MRF) framework that provides the machinery for inferring the positions of WMHs in novel test images. The method is shown to accurately detect WMHs in a set of 114 elderly subjects from an academic dementia clinic. Experiments show that standard off-the-shelf MRF training and inference methods provide robust results, and that increasing the complexity of neighborhood dependency models does not necessarily help performance. The method is also shown to perform well when training and test data are drawn from distinct scanners and subject pools.},

However, although it is largely “automated,” VBM is rarely implemented consistently across studies, and changing user-specified options can alter the results in a way similar to the very biologic differences under investigation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This work uses data from patients with HD to demonstrate the effects of several user-specified VBM parameters and analyses: type and level of statistical correction, modula- tion, smoothing kernel size, adjustment for brain size, subgroup analysis, and software version. RESULTS: The results demonstrate that changing these options can alter results in a way similar to the biologic differences under investigation. CONCLUSIONS: If VBM is to be useful clinically or considered for use as a biomarker, there is a need for greater recognition of these issues and more uniformity in its application for the method to be both reproducible and valid.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are areas of increased signal on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans that most commonly reflect small vessel cerebrovascular disease. Increased WMH volume is associated with risk and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These observations are typically interpreted as evidence that vascular abnormalities play an additive, independent role contributing to symptom presentation, but not core features of AD. We examined the severity and distribution of WMH in presymptomatic PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP mutation carriers to determine the extent to which WMH manifest in individuals genetically determined to develop AD. METHODS The study comprised participants (n = 299; age = 39.03 ± 10.13) from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network, including 184 (61.5{\%}) with a mutation that results in AD and 115 (38.5{\%}) first-degree relatives who were noncarrier controls. We calculated the estimated years from expected symptom onset (EYO) by subtracting the affected parent's symptom onset age from the participant's age. Baseline MRI data were analyzed for total and regional WMH. Mixed-effects piece-wise linear regression was used to examine WMH differences between carriers and noncarriers with respect to EYO. RESULTS Mutation carriers had greater total WMH volumes, which appeared to increase approximately 6 years before expected symptom onset. Effects were most prominent for the parietal and occipital lobe, which showed divergent effects as early as 22 years before estimated onset. INTERPRETATION Autosomal-dominant AD is associated with increased WMH well before expected symptom onset. The findings suggest the possibility that WMHs are a core feature of AD, a potential therapeutic target, and a factor that should be integrated into pathogenic models of the disease.

One type of phenotypic screening, image-based high-content screening (HCS), has been seen as particularly promising. In this article, we assess whether HCS is as high content as it can be. We analyze HCS publications and find that although the number of HCS experiments published each year continues to grow steadily, the information content lags behind. We find that a majority of high-content screens published so far (60-80{\%}) made use of only one or two image-based features measured from each sample and disregarded the distribution of those features among each cell population. We discuss several potential explanations, focusing on the hypothesis that data analysis traditions are to blame. This includes practical problems related to managing large and multidimensional HCS data sets as well as the adoption of assay quality statistics from HTS to HCS. Both may have led to the simplification or systematic rejection of assays carrying complex and valuable phenotypic information. We predict that advanced data analysis methods that enable full multiparametric data to be harvested for entire cell populations will enable HCS to finally reach its potential.},

abstract = {Background and purpose Baseline collateral status has been correlated with outcomes of acute ischaemic stroke patients receiving intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in previous studies. We carried out the current systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize currently available evidence regarding such correlations. Methods Full-text articles published since 2000 were retrieved and screened. The overall effect sizes of good versus poor collateral status over a series of outcomes and certain baseline features were estimated by random-effects models and presented in risk ratios (RRs) or mean differences. Results Overall, 28 (3057 patients) and 14 (1584 patients) studies were included in qualitative and quantitative synthesis, respectively. Compared with poor pre-treatment collateral status, good collaterals showed a beneficial effect over the primary outcome of a favorable functional outcome at 3 or 6 months [RR, 2.45; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.94–3.09; P {\textless} 0.001] in acute ischaemic stroke patients receiving IVT treatment. However, such an effect tended to be different between studies with prescribed time windows of 3, 4.5 and {\textgreater} 4.5 h (up to 7 h), with the RRs being 2.21, 2.48 and 5.00, respectively (I2 = 53{\%}). Good pre-treatment collaterals were also associated with a smaller infarct size at baseline, and a lower rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and a higher rate of neurological improvement early after IVT treatment. Conclusions The present study has demonstrated the prognostic value of baseline collateral circulation for outcomes of acute ischaemic stroke patients receiving intravenous reperfusion therapies, studied with different time windows of up to 7 h after ictus for IVT therapy.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare qualitatively and quantitatively the contrast of brain lesions detected with fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) and intermediate-weighted sequences at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective study, 47 patients suspected of having a brain lesion underwent MR imaging with FLAIR, intermediate-weighted, and T2-weighted sequences. Qualitative assessment was performed of lesion conspicuity, detection, overall image artifact, and additional clinical information. Contrast and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were calculated between lesions and the normal brain or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). RESULTS: FLAIR images were equal to intermediate-weighted images for overall lesion conspicuity and detection but were associated more often with image artifacts. Lesion-to-background contrast was significantly higher on FLAIR than on intermediate-weighted images. FLAIR images failed to demonstrate multiple sclerosis (MS) plaques located in the basal ganglia and brain stem. CONCLUSION: Although FLAIR images provided additional information in some cases, they did not have distinct advantages over intermediate-weighted images.

Except in cases of MS, either FLAIR or intermediate-weighted sequences should be added to T2-weighted sequences at MR imaging.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: With the advent of noninvasive neuroimaging, a plethora of digital human neuroanatomical atlases has been developed. The accuracy of these atlases is constrained by the resolution and signal-gathering powers of available imaging equipment. In an attempt to circumvent these limitations and to produce a high resolution in vivo human neuroanatomy, we investigated the usefulness of intrasubject registration for post hoc MR signal averaging. METHOD: Twenty-seven high resolution (7 x 0.78 and 20 x 1.0 mm3) T1-weighted volumes were acquired from a single subject, along with 12 double echo T2/proton density-weighted volumes. These volumes were automatically registered to a common stereotaxic space in which they were subsampled and intensity averaged. The resulting images were examined for anatomical quality and usefulness for other analytical techniques. RESULTS: The quality of the resulting image from the combination of as few as five T1 volumes was visibly enhanced. The signal-to-noise ratio was expected to increase as the root of the number of contributing scans to 5.2, n = 27. The improvement in the n = 27 average was great enough that fine anatomical details, such as thalamic subnuclei and the gray bridges between the caudate and putamen, became crisply defined. The gray/white matter boundaries were also enhanced, as was the visibility of any finer structure that was surrounded by tissue of varying T1 intensity. The T2 and proton density average images were also of higher quality than single scans, but the improvement was not as dramatic as that of the T1 volumes. CONCLUSION: Overall, the enhanced signal in the averaged images resulted in higher quality anatomical images, and the data lent themselves to several postprocessing techniques. The high quality of the enhanced images permits novel uses of the data and extends the possibilities for in vivo human neuroanatomy.},

abstract = {Purpose: It has been reported that increased white matter lesions (WML) is one of the risk factors for stroke. To quantify WML objectively with the presence of acute infarcts, we proposed an automated segmentation scheme to locate WMLs in combined T1-weighted MRI, fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). Materials and methods: The proposed method detects WMLs by a coarse-to-fine mathematical morphology method. It has been evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively using voxel-based, volume-based, score-based, and atlas-based approaches on MRI data of 91 subjects with acute infarction. Result: The proposed WML detection algorithm yields average sensitivity, positive predictive value and similarity index of 0.803, 0.818, and 0.836, respectively. Experimental results demonstrated that the segmentation from the proposed method is in high agreement with that from manual segmentation (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.9892), and with a good correlation with visual scores (R=0.8442, p{\textless}0.0001). {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The etiology of DN loss in sporadic PD is unknown, although it is hypothesized that aberrant protein aggregation and cellular oxidative stress may promote DN degeneration. Homozygous mutations in DJ-1 were recently described in two families with autosomal recessive inherited PD (Bonifati et al. 2003). In a companion article (Martinat et al. 2004), we show that mutations in DJ-1 alter the cellular response to oxidative stress and proteasomal inhibition. Here we show that DJ-1 functions as a redox-sensitive molecular chaperone that is activated in an oxidative cytoplasmic environment. We further demonstrate that DJ-1 chaperone activity in vivo extends to alpha-synuclein, a protein implicated in PD pathogenesis.},

abstract = {The location and extent of white matter lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are important criteria for diagnosis, follow-up and prognosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Clinical trials have shown that quantitative values, such as lesion volumes, are meaningful in MS prognosis. Manual lesion delineation for the segmentation of lesions is, however, time-consuming and suffers from observer variability. In this paper, we propose MSmetrix, an accurate and reliable automatic method for lesion segmentation based on MRI, independent of scanner or acquisition protocol and without requiring any training data. In MSmetrix, 3D T1-weighted and FLAIR MR images are used in a probabilistic model to detect white matter (WM) lesions as an outlier to normal brain while segmenting the brain tissue into grey matter, WM and cerebrospinal fluid. The actual lesion segmentation is performed based on prior knowledge about the location (within WM) and the appearance (hyperintense on FLAIR) of lesions. The accuracy of MSmetrix is evaluated by comparing its output with expert reference segmentations of 20 MRI datasets of MS patients. Spatial overlap (Dice) between the MSmetrix and the expert lesion segmentation is 0.67 ± 0.11. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) equals 0.8 indicating a good volumetric agreement between the MSmetrix and expert labelling. The reproducibility of MSmetrix' lesion volumes is evaluated based on 10 MS patients, scanned twice with a short interval on three different scanners. The agreement between the first and the second scan on each scanner is evaluated through the spatial overlap and absolute lesion volume difference between them. The spatial overlap was 0.69 ± 0.14 and absolute total lesion volume difference between the two scans was 0.54 ± 0.58 ml. Finally, the accuracy and reproducibility of MSmetrix compare favourably with other publicly available MS lesion segmentation algorithms, applied on the same data using default parameter settings.},

abstract = {In this paper, a new technique is proposed for automatic segmentation of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions from brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. The technique uses a trained support vector machine (SVM) to discriminate between the blocks in regions of MS lesions and the blocks in non-MS lesion regions mainly based on the textural features with aid of the other features. The classification is done on each of the axial, sagittal and coronal sectional brain view independently and the resultant segmentations are aggregated to provide more accurate output segmentation. The main contribution of the proposed technique described in this paper is the use of textural features to detect MS lesions in a fully automated approach that does not rely on manually delineating the MS lesions. In addition, the technique introduces the concept of the multi-sectional view segmentation to produce verified segmentation. The proposed textural-based SVM technique was evaluated using three simulated datasets and more than fifty real MRI datasets. The results were compared with state of the art methods. The obtained results indicate that the proposed method would be viable for use in clinical practice for the detection of MS lesions in MRI.},

@article{Maranzano2016,
abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Double inversion recovery has been suggested as the MR imaging contrast of choice for segmenting cortical lesions in patients with multiple sclerosis. In this study, we sought to determine the utility of double inversion recovery for cortical lesion identification by comparing 3 MR imaging reading protocols that combine different MR imaging contrasts. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-five patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 3 with secondary-progressive MS were imaged with 3T MR imaging by using double inversion recovery, dual fast spin-echo proton-density/T2-weighted, 3D FLAIR, and 3D T1-weighted imaging sequences. Lesions affecting the cortex were manually segmented by using the following 3 MR imaging reading protocols: Protocol 1 (P1) used all available MR imaging contrasts; protocol 2 (P2) used all the available contrasts except for double inversion recovery; and protocol 3(P3) used only double inversion recovery. RESULTS Six hundred forty-three cortical lesions were identified with P1 (mean = 22.96); 633, with P2 (mean = 22.6); and 280, with P3 (mean = 10). The counts obtained by using P1 and P2 were not significantly different (P = .93). The counts obtained by using P3 were significantly smaller than those obtained by using either P1 (P {\textless} .001) or P2 (P {\textless} .001). The intraclass correlation coefficients were P1 versus P2 = 0.989, P1 versus P3 = 0.615, and P2 versus P3 = 0.588. CONCLUSIONS MR imaging cortical lesion segmentation can be performed by using 3D T1-weighted and 3D FLAIR images acquired with a 1-mm isotropic voxel size, supported by conventional T2-weighted and proton-density images with 3-mm-thick sections. Inclusion of double inversion recovery in this multimodal reading protocol did not significantly improve the cortical lesion identification rate. A multimodal approach is superior to using double inversion recovery alone.},

abstract = {Intensity-based classification of MR images has proven problematic, even when advanced techniques are used. Intrascan and interscan intensity inhomogeneities are a common source of difficulty. While reported methods have had some success in correcting intrascan inhomogeneities, such methods require supervision for the individual scan. This paper describes a new method called adaptive segmentation that uses knowledge of tissue intensity properties and intensity inhomogeneities to correct and segment MR images. Use of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm leads to a method that allows for more accurate segmentation of tissue types as well as better visualization of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, that has proven to be effective in a study that includes more than 1000 brain scans. Implementation and results are described for segmenting the brain in the following types of images: axial (dual-echo spin-echo), coronal [three dimensional Fourier transform (3-DFT) gradient-echo T1-weighted] all using a conventional head coil, and a sagittal section acquired using a surface coil. The accuracy of adaptive segmentation was found to be comparable with manual segmentation, and closer to manual segmentation than supervised multivariant classification while segmenting gray and white matter.},

abstract = {Detection of new Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is important as a marker of disease activity and as a potential surrogate for relapses. We propose an approach where sequential scans are jointly segmented, to provide a temporally consistent tissue segmentation while remaining sensitive to newly appearing lesions. The method uses a two-stage classification process: 1) a Bayesian classifier provides a probabilistic brain tissue classification at each voxel of reference and follow-up scans, and 2) a random-forest based lesion-level classification provides a final identification of new lesions. Generative models are learned based on 364 scans from 95 subjects from a multi-center clinical trial. The method is evaluated on sequential brain MRI of 160 subjects from a separate multi-center clinical trial, and is compared to 1) semi-automatically generated ground truth segmentations and 2) fully manual identification of new lesions generated independently by nine expert raters on a subset of 60 subjects. For new lesions greater than 0.15 cc in size, the classifier has near perfect performance (99{\%} sensitivity, 2{\%} false detection rate), as compared to ground truth. The proposed method was also shown to exceed the performance of any one of the nine expert manual identifications.},

abstract = {Purpose.: To automatically segment multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions into three subtypes (i.e., enhancing lesions, T1 "black holes", T2 hyperintense lesions). Materials and methods.: Proton density-, T2- and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted brain images of 12 MR scans were pre-processed through intracranial cavity (IC) extraction, inhomogeneity correction and intensity normalization. Intensity-based statistical k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classification was combined with template-driven segmentation and partial volume artifact correction (TDS+) for segmentation of MS lesions subtypes and brain tissue compartments. Operator-supervised tissue sampling and parameter calibration were performed on 2 randomly selected scans and were applied automatically to the remaining 10 scans. Results from this three-channel TDS+ (3ch-TDS+) were compared to those from a previously validated two-channel TDS+ (2ch-TDS+) method. The results of both the 3ch-TDS+ and 2ch-TDS+ were also compared to manual segmentation performed by experts. Results.: Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) of 3ch-TDS+ for all three subtypes of lesions were higher (ICC between 0.95 and 0.96) than that of 2ch-TDS+ for T2 lesions (ICC??=??0.82). The 3ch-TDS+ also identified the three lesion subtypes with high specificity (98.7-99.9{\%}) and accuracy (98.5-99.9{\%}). Sensitivity of 3ch-TDS+ for T2 lesions was 16{\%} higher than with 2ch-TDS+. Enhancing lesions were segmented with the best sensitivity (81.9{\%}). "Black holes" were segmented with the least sensitivity (62.3{\%}). Conclusion.: 3ch-TDS+ is a promising method for automated segmentation of MS lesion subtypes. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The large spatial inhomogeneity in transmit B1 field (B1+) observable in human MR images at high static magnetic fields (B0) severely impairs image quality. To overcome this effect in brain T1-weighted images, the MPRAGE sequence was modified to generate two different images at different inversion times, MP2RAGE. By combining the two images in a novel fashion, it was possible to create T1-weigthed images where the result image was free of proton density contrast, T2* contrast, reception bias field, and, to first order, transmit field inhomogeneity. MP2RAGE sequence parameters were optimized using Bloch equations to maximize contrast-to-noise ratio per unit of time between brain tissues and minimize the effect of B1+ variations through space. Images of high anatomical quality and excellent brain tissue differentiation suitable for applications such as segmentation and voxel-based morphometry were obtained at 3 and 7 T. From such T1-weighted images, acquired within 12 min, high-resolution 3D T1 maps were routinely calculated at 7 T with sub-millimeter voxel resolution (0.65-0.85??mm isotropic). T1 maps were validated in phantom experiments. In humans, the T1 values obtained at 7 T were 1.15 ?? 0.06 s for white matter (WM) and 1.92 ?? 0.16 s for grey matter (GM), in good agreement with literature values obtained at lower spatial resolution. At 3 T, where whole-brain acquisitions with 1??mm isotropic voxels were acquired in 8 min, the T1 values obtained (0.81 ?? 0.03 s for WM and 1.35 ?? 0.05 for GM) were once again found to be in very good agreement with values in the literature. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A new method has been developed for probabilistic segmentation of five different types of brain structures: white matter, gray matter, cerebro-spinal fluid without ventricles, ventricles and white matter lesion in cranial MR imaging. The algorithm is based on information from T1-weighted (T1-w), inversion recovery (IR), proton density-weighted (PD), T2-weighted (T2-w) and fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) scans. It uses the K-Nearest Neighbor classification technique that builds a feature space from spatial information and voxel intensities. The technique generates for each tissue type an image representing the probability per voxel being part of it. By application of thresholds on these probability maps, binary segmentations can be obtained. A similarity index (SI) and a probabilistic SI (PSI) were calculated for quantitative evaluation of the results. The influence of each image type on the performance was investigated by alternately leaving out one of the five scan types. This procedure showed that the incorporation of the T1-w, PD or T2-w did not significantly improve the segmentation results. Further investigation indicated that the combination of IR and FLAIR was optimal for segmentation of the five brain tissue types. Evaluation with respect to the gold standard showed that the SI-values for all tissues exceeded 0.8 and all PSI-values exceeded 0.7, implying an excellent agreement.},

abstract = {A new algorithm is presented for the automatic segmentation of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesions in 3D Magnetic Resonance (MR) images. It builds on a discriminative random decision forest framework to provide a voxel-wise probabilistic classification of the volume. The method uses multi-channel MR intensities (T1, T2, and FLAIR), knowledge on tissue classes and long-range spatial context to discriminate lesions from background. A symmetry feature is introduced accounting for the fact that some MS lesions tend to develop in an asymmetric way. Quantitative evaluation of the proposed methods is carried out on publicly available labeled cases from the MICCAI MS Lesion Segmentation Challenge 2008 dataset. When tested on the same data, the presented method compares favorably to all earlier methods. In an a posteriori analysis, we show how selected features during classification can be ranked according to their discriminative power and reveal the most important ones.},

abstract = {A fully automatic Bayesian framework for multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion classification is presented, using posterior probability distributions and entropy values to classify normal and lesion tissue. Spatial variability in intensities of multimodal MR images over the brain is explicitly modeled by building region-specific multivariate likelihood distributions. Local smoothness is ensured by incorporating neighboring voxel tissue information using Markov Random fields. A probabilistic measure of confidence for the classification is then presented, which can also be used to assess disease burden. The method was tested on 10 patients with MS by comparing automatically classified lesions, with and without regional information, to manual classifications by five expert raters using volume count and overlap. Results improve with the incorporation of spatial information, and are comparable to manual classifications. This method also enables a more accurate classification in the posterior fossa, where no other method reports success.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Perfusion imaging sequences are an important part of imaging studies designed to provide information to guide therapy for treatment of cerebrovascular disease. The purpose of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of the medical literature on perfusion imaging to determine its role in clinical decision making for patients with acute cerebral ischemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE by using a strategy that combined terms related to perfusion imaging with terms related to acute cerebral ischemia and brain tumors. We identified 658 perfusion imaging articles and classified them according to the clinical usefulness criteria of Thornbury and Fryback. We found 59 articles with promise of indicating usefulness in clinical decision making. We devised and implemented a clinical decision making scoring scale more appropriate to the topic of acute cerebral ischemia. RESULTS: Several articles provided important insights into the physiologic processes underlying acute cerebral ischemia by correlation of initial perfusion imaging deficits with clinical outcome or ultimate size of the infarct. However, most articles showed relatively low relevance to influencing decisions in implementing treatment. CONCLUSION: Most perfusion imaging articles are oriented toward important topics such as optimization of imaging parameters, determination of ischemia penumbra, and prediction of outcome. However, information as to the role of perfusion imaging in clinical decision making is lacking. Studies are needed to demonstrate that use of perfusion imaging changes outcome of patients with acute cerebral ischemia.},

abstract = {White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are brain areas of increased signal on T2-weighted or fluid-attenuated inverse recovery magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. In this study we present a new semi-automated method to measure WMH load that is based on the segmentation of the intensity histogram of fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. Thirty patients with mild cognitive impairment with variable WMH load were enrolled. The semi-automated WMH segmentation included removal of non-brain tissue, spatial normalization, removal of cerebellum and brain stem, spatial filtering, thresholding to segment probable WMH, manual editing for correction of false positives and negatives, generation of WMH map, and volumetric estimation of the WMH load. Accuracy was quantitatively evaluated by comparing semi-automated and manual WMH segmentations performed by two independent raters. Differences between the two procedures were assessed using Student's t-tests and similarity was evaluated using linear regression model and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). The volumes of the manual and semi-automated segmentations did not statistically differ (t-value = -1.79, DF = 29, p = 0.839 for rater 1; t-value = 1.113, DF = 29, p = 0.2749 for rater 2), were highly correlated [R (2) = 0.921, F (1,29) = 155.54, p {\textless} 0.0001 for rater 1; R (2) = 0.935, F (1,29) = 402.709, p {\textless} 0.0001 for rater 2] and showed a very strong spatial similarity (mean DSC = 0.78, for rater 1 and 0.77 for rater 2). In conclusion, our semi-automated method to measure the load of WMH is highly reliable and could represent a good tool that could be easily implemented in routinely neuroimaging analyses to map clinical consequences of WMH.},

abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease with profound heterogeneity in clinical course, neuroradiological appearance of the lesions, involvement of susceptibility gene loci, and response to therapy. These features are supported by experimental evidence, which demonstrates that fundamentally different processes, such as autoimmunity or virus infection, may induce MS-like inflammatory demyelinating plaques and suggest that MS may be a disease with heterogeneous pathogenetic mechanisms. From a large pathology sample of MS, collected in three international centers, we selected 51 biopsies and 32 autopsies that contained actively demyelinating lesions defined by stringent criteria. The pathology of the lesions was analyzed using a broad spectrum of immunological and neurobiological markers. Four fundamentally different patterns of demyelination were found, defined on the basis of myelin protein loss, the geography and extension of plaques, the patterns of oligodendrocyte destruction, and the immunopathological evidence of complement activation. Two patterns (I and II) showed close similarities to T-cell-mediated or T-cell plus antibody-mediated autoimmune encephalomyelitis, respectively. The other patterns (III and IV) were highly suggestive of a primary oligodendrocyte dystrophy, reminiscent of virus- or toxin-induced demyelination rather than autoimmunity. At a given time point of the disease--as reflected in autopsy cases--the patterns of demyelination were heterogeneous between patients, but were homogenous within multiple active lesions from the same patient. This pathogenetic heterogeneity of plaques from different MS patients may have fundamental implications for the diagnosis and therapy of this disease.},

abstract = {Relaxation time measurements at 3.0 T are reported for both gray and white matter in normal human brain. Measurements were made using a 3.0 T Bruker Biospec magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner in normal adults with no clinical evidence of neurological disease. Nineteen subjects, 8 female and 11 male, were studied for T1 and T2 measurements, and 7 males were studied for T*2. Measurements were made using a saturation recovery method for T1, a multiple spin-echo experiment for T2, and a fast low-angle shot (FLASH) sequence with 14 different echo times for T*2. Results of the measurements are summarized as follows. Average T1 values measured for gray matter and white matter were 1331 and 832 msec, respectively. Average T2 values measured for gray matter and white matter were 80 and 110 msec, respectively. The average T*2 values for occipital and frontal gray matter were 41.6 and 51.8 msec, respectively. Average T*2 values for occipital and frontal white matter were 48.4 and 44.7 msec, respectively. ANOVA tests of the measurements revealed that for both gray and white matter there were no significant differences in T1 from one location in the brain to another. T2 in occipital gray matter was significantly higher (0.0001 {\textless} P {\textless} .0375) than the rest of the gray matter, while T2 in frontal white matter was significantly lower (P {\textless} 0.0001). Statistical analysis of cerebral hemispheric differences in relaxation time measurements showed no significant differences in T1 values from the left hemisphere compared with the right, except in insular gray matter, where this difference was significant at P = 0.0320. No significant difference in T2 values existed between the left and right cerebral hemispheres. Significant differences were apparent between male and female relaxation time measurements in brain. J.

abstract = {Because of the major difficulties in measuring clinical end points in multi ple sclerosis (MS) treatment trials, there has been much enthusiasm for usi ng magnetic resonance imaging (MRT) findings as an alternative outcome. To provide international consensus guidelines for the use of MRI in MS clinica l trials, a task force of the US National MS Society was convened. The reco mmendations of the task force are presented in this review. Given the high sensitivity for detecting pathological activity in relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive MS, monthly T2-weighted and gadolinium-enhanced brain MRT is an excellent tool for short-term exploratory trials of new agents w here it serves as the primary end point; in particular, failure to demonstr ate a reduction in lesion activity avoids the time, cost, and risks of a la rger clinical end point study. However, conventional MRI findings have a li mited correlation with disability in established MS. The primary end point of a definitive trial should therefore be clinical, although serial MRI at 6- to 12-month intervals is a useful secondary end point in providing an in dex of pathological progression. In trials of patients presenting with clin ically isolated syndromes suggestive of MS, MRT findings can be used in the entry criteria, and as a secondary outcome measure, but conversion to clin ically definite MS should be the primary outcome. The pathological substrat es of irreversible disability are demyelination and axonal loss. Putative m agnetic resonance markers for these processes include decreased N-acetylasp artate on proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, decreased magnetization t ransfer ratios, hypointensity on T1-weighted images, and loss of short T2 w ater fractions, some of which relate more closely to disability than conven tional MRI findings. Further technical developments should lead to more acc urate quantitation, greater pathological specificity, and stronger clinical correlations.},

In this letter, we address the problem of efficient training of convolutional deep belief networks by learning the weights in the frequency domain, which eliminates the time-consuming calculation of convolutions. An essential consideration in the design of the algorithm is to minimize the number of transformations to and from frequency space. We have evaluated the running time improvements using two standard benchmark data sets, showing a speed-up of up to 8 times on 2D images and up to 200 times on 3D volumes. Our training algorithm makes training of convolutional deep belief networks on 3D medical images with a resolution of up to 128 × 128 × 128 voxels practical, which opens new directions for using deep learning for medical image analysis.},

The procedure can be divided into four main steps: 1) pre-processing with color unmixing and morphological operators, 2) marker-controlled watershed segmentation at multiple scales and with different markers, 3) post-processing for rejection of false regions and 4) merging of the results from multiple scales. The procedure was developed on a set of 21 breast cancer cases (subset A) and tested on a separate validation set of 18 cases (subset B). The evaluation was done in terms of both detection accuracy (sensitivity and positive predictive value) and segmentation accuracy (Dice coefficient). The mean estimated sensitivity for subset A was 0.875 (±0.092) and for subset B 0.853 (±0.077). The mean estimated positive predictive value was 0.904 (±0.075) and 0.886 (±0.069) for subsets A and B, respectively. For both subsets, the distribution of the Dice coefficients had a high peak around 0.9, with the vast majority of segmentations having values larger than 0.8.},

abstract = {Goal: In this paper, a fully automatic probabilistic method for multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion classification is presented, whereby the posterior probability density function over healthy tissues and two types of lesions (T1-hypointense and T2-hyperintense) is generated at every voxel. Methods: During training, the system explicitly models the spatial variability of the intensity distributions throughout the brain by first segmenting it into distinct anatomical regions and then building regional likelihood distributions for each tissue class based on multimodal magnetic resonance image (MRI) intensities. Local class smoothness is ensured by incorporating neighboring voxel information in the prior probability through Markov random fields. The system is tested on two datasets from real multisite clinical trials consisting of multimodal MRIs from a total of 100 patients with MS. Lesion classification results based on the framework are compared with and without the regional information, as well as with other state-of-The-Art methods against the labels from expert manual raters. The metrics for comparison include Dice overlap, sensitivity, and positive predictive rates for both voxel and lesion classifications. Results: Statistically significant improvements in Dice values ( p {\textless} 0.01), for voxel-based and lesion-based sensitivity values (p {\textless} 0.001), and positive predictive rates (p {\textless} 0.001 and p {\textless} 0.01 respectively) are shown when the proposed method is compared to the method without regional information, and to a widely used method [1]. This holds particularly true in the posterior fossa, an area where classification is very challenging. Significance: The proposed method allows us to provide clinicians with accurate tissue labels for T1-hypointense and T2-hyperintense lesions, two types of lesions that differ in appearance and clinical ramifications, and with a confidence level in the classification, which helps clinicians assess the classification results.},

abstract = {Data sharing is becoming more of a requirement as technologies mature and as global research and communications diversify. As a result, researchers are looking for practical solutions, not only to enhance scientific collaborations, but also to acquire larger amounts of data, and to access specialized datasets. In many cases, the realities of data acquisition present a significant burden, therefore gaining access to public datasets allows for more robust analyses and broadly enriched data exploration. To answer this demand, the Montreal Neurological Institute has announced its commitment to Open Science, harnessing the power of making both clinical and research data available to the world (Owens 2016). As such, the LORIS and CBRAIN (Das 2015) platforms have been tasked with the technical challenges specific to the institutional-level implementation of open data sharing, including: 1) Comprehensive linking of multimodal data (phenotypic. clinical, neuroimaging, biobanking and genomics, etc.) 2) Secure database encryption, specifically designed for institutional and multi-project data sharing, ensuring subject confidentiality (using multi-tiered identifiers). 3) Querying capabilities with multiple levels of single study and institutional permissions, allowing public data sharing for all consented and de-identified subject data. 4) Configurable pipelines and flags to facilitate acquisition and analysis, as well as access to High Performance Computing clusters for rapid data processing and sharing of software tools. 5) Robust Workflows and Quality Control mechanisms ensuring transparency and consistency in best practices. 6) Long term storage (and web access) of data, reducing loss of institutional data assets. 7) Enhanced web-based visualization of imaging, genomics, and phenotypic data, allowing for real-time viewing and manipulation of data from anywhere in the world. 8) Numerous modules for data filtering, summary statistics, and personalized and configurable dashboards. Implementing the vision of Open Science at the Montreal Neurological Institute will be a concerted undertaking that seeks to facilitate data sharing for the global research community. Our goal is to utilize the years of experience in multi-site collaborative research infrastructure to implement the technical requirements to achieve this level of public data sharing in a practical, yet robust manner.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is used widely for assessment of patients with cognitive impairment, but the pathological correlates are unclear, especially when multiple pathologies are present. METHODS: This report includes 93 subjects from a longitudinally followed cohort recruited for the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and subcortical cerebrovascular disease (CVD). MR images were analyzed to quantify cortical gray matter volume, hippocampal volume, white matter hyperintensities, and lacunes. Neuropathological examination quantified CVD parenchymal pathology, AD pathology (defined as Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease scores and Braak and Braak stage), and hippocampal sclerosis. Subjects were pathologically classified as 12 healthy control subjects, 46 AD, 14 CVD, 9 mixed AD/CVD, and 12 cognitively impaired patients without significant AD/CVD pathology. Multivariate models tested associations between magnetic resonance and pathological findings across the entire sample. RESULTS: Pathological correlates of cortical gray matter volume were AD, subcortical vascular pathology, and arteriosclerosis. Hippocampal volume was related to AD pathology and hippocampal sclerosis, and the effects of hippocampal sclerosis were greater for subjects with low levels of AD pathology. White matter hyperintensities were related to age and to white matter pathology. Number of MRI lacunes was related to subcortical vascular pathology. INTERPRETATION: In this clinical setting, the presence of lacunes and white matter changes provide a good signal for vascular disease. The neuropathological basis of MR defined cerebral cortical and hippocampal atrophy in aging and dementia is complex, with several pathological processes converging on similar brain structures that mediate cognitive decline.},

abstract = {The correction of intensity non-uniformity (INU) in magnetic resonance (MR) images is extremely important to ensure both within-subject and across-subject reliability. Here we tackled the problemof objectively comparing INU correction techniques for T1-weighted images, which are the most commonly used in structural brain imaging. We focused our investigations on the methods integrated in widely used software packages for MR data analysis: FreeSurfer, BrainVoyager, SPM and FSL. We used simulated data to assess the INU fields reconstructed by those methods for controlled inhomogeneity magnitudes and noise levels. For each method, we evaluated a wide range of input parameters and defined an enhanced configuration associated with best recon- struction performance. By comparing enhanced and default configurations, we found that the former often provide much more accurate results. Accordingly, we used enhanced configurations for a more objective comparison between methods. For different levels of INU magnitude and noise, SPM and FSL, which integrate INUcorrection with brain segmentation, generally outperformed FreeSurfer and BrainVoyager, whose methods are exclusively dedicated to INU correction. Nonetheless, accurate INU field reconstructions can be obtained with FreeSurfer on images with low noise and with BrainVoyager for slow and smooth inhomogeneity profiles. Our study may prove helpful for an accurate selection of the INUcorrection method to be used based on the characteristics of actual MR data.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is very sensitive for the detection of white matter lesions (WML), which occur even in normal ageing. Intrinsic WML should be separated from physiological changes in the ageing brain, such as periventricular caps and bands, and from dilated Virchow-Robin spaces. Genuine WML are best seen with T2-weighted sequences such as long TR dual-echo spin-echo or FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery); the latter has the advantage of easily separating WML from CSF-like lesions. Abnormal T2 signal in MRI is not specific, and can accompany any change in tissue composition. In the work-up of WML in small vessel disease, magnetic resonance angiography can be used to rule out (concomitant) large vessel disease, and diffusion-weighted MRI to identify new ischaemic lesions (amidst pre-existing old WML). The differential diagnosis of WML includes hereditary leukodystrophies and acquired disorders. The leukodystrophies that can present in adult age include metachromatic leukodystrophy, globoid cell leukodystrophy, adrenomyeloneuropathy, mitochondrial disorders, vanishing white matter, and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. These metabolic disorders typically present with symmetrical abnormalities that can be very diffuse, often with involvement of brainstem and cerebellum. Only the mitochondrial disorders tend to be more asymmetric and frequently involve the grey matter preferentially. Among the acquired white matter disorders, hypoxic-ischaemic causes are by far the most prevalent and without further clinical clues there is no need to even consider the next most common disorder, i.e. multiple sclerosis (MS). Among the nonischaemic disorders, MS is far more common than vasculitis, infection, intoxication and trauma. While vasculitis can mimic small vessel disease, MS has distinctive features with preferential involvement of the subcortical U-fibres, the corpus callosum, temporal lobes and the brainstem/cerebellum. Spinal cord lesions are very common in MS, but do not occur in normal ageing nor in small vessel disease.},

This variant is shown empirically to give faster convergence in a mixture estimation problem.

abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating autoimmune disease that attacks the central nervous system (CNS) and affects more than 2 million people worldwide. The segmentation of MS lesions in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a very important task to assess how a patient is responding to treatment and how the disease is progressing. Computational approaches have been proposed over the years to segment MS lesions and reduce the amount of time spent on manual delineation and inter- and intra-rater variability and bias. However, fully-automatic segmentation of MS lesions still remains an open problem. In this work, we propose an iterative approach using Student's t mixture models and probabilistic anatomical atlases to automatically segment MS lesions in Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) images. Our technique resembles a refinement approach by iteratively segmenting brain tissues into smaller classes until MS lesions are grouped as the most hyperintense one. To validate our technique we used 21 clinical images from the 2015 Longitudinal Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation Challenge dataset. Evaluation using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), True Positive Ratio (TPR), False Positive Ratio (FPR), Volume Difference (VD) and Pearson's r coefficient shows that our technique has a good spatial and volumetric agreement with raters' manual delineations. Also, a comparison between our proposal and the state-of-the-art shows that our technique is comparable and, in some cases, better than some approaches, thus being a viable alternative for automatic MS lesion segmentation in MRI.},

abstract = {Automated gray matter segmentation of magnetic resonance imaging data is essential for morphometric analyses of the brain, particularly when large sample sizes are investigated. However, although detection of small structural brain differences may fundamentally depend on the method used, both accuracy and reliability of different automated segmentation algorithms have rarely been compared. Here, performance of the segmentation algorithms provided by SPM8, VBM8, FSL and FreeSurfer was quantified on simulated and real magnetic resonance imaging data. First, accuracy was assessed by comparing segmentations of twenty simulated and 18 real T1 images with corresponding ground truth images. Second, reliability was determined in ten T1 images from the same subject and in ten T1 images of different subjects scanned twice. Third, the impact of preprocessing steps on segmentation accuracy was investigated. VBM8 showed a very high accuracy and a very high reliability. FSL achieved the highest accuracy but demonstrated poor reliability and FreeSurfer showed the lowest accuracy, but high reliability. An universally valid recommendation on how to implement morphometric analyses is not warranted due to the vast number of scanning and analysis parameters. However, our analysis suggests that researchers can optimize their individual processing procedures with respect to final segmentation quality and exemplifies adequate performance criteria.},

abstract = {Postmortem unfixed whole brains from five multiple sclerosis (MS) patients were examined by MRI using a T2- and T1-weighted spin-echo (SE) sequence and histology to investigate the histopathologic characteristics of hypointense lesions on T1-weighted SE MR images. The degree of hypointensity was scored semiquantitatively by two blinded observers in reference to normal-appearing white matter. Signal intensities of the lesions and the normal-appearing white matter were measured to obtain contrast ratios. Hematoxylin-eosin stain was used to assess degree of matrix destruction (decrease of density of the neuropil) and cellularity of a lesion, Kl{\"{u}}ver-Barrera stain for degree of demyelination, Bodian stain for axonal density, and immunostaining of glial fibrillary acid protein for reactive astrocytes and fibrillary gliosis. Nineteen lesions were selected for analysis. Nearly all lesions were compatible with the chronic MS plaque: hypocellularity, absence of myelinated axons, in the presence of reactive astrocytes. Contrast ratios of the lesions were highly correlated (R = -0.90; p {\textless} 0.01), with degree of hypointensity scored semiquantitatively. Degree of hypointensity on T1-weighted SE images did not correlate with degree of demyelination or number of reactive astrocytes, but was associated with axonal density (R =-0.71; p = 0.001). A trend was found with degree of matrix destruction (R = 0.45; p = 0.052). We conclude that, in our limited sample, hypointense lesions seen on T1-weighted SE MR images are associated histopathologically with severe tissue destruction, including axonal loss. Our results need to be substantiated in a larger study on more varied patient material to evaluate the use of hypointense lesions as a surrogate marker of persistent deficit in MS patients.},

Our purpose was to examine if imaging at 8T can detect plaques in cortical gray matter (CGM) not evident at 1.5T.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: An ex-vivo brain obtained at autopsy from a patient with MS was formalin fixed and 1 cm coronal slices were examined using MR imaging at 8T.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Numerous cerebral cortical lesions not evident at 1.5T were seen at 8T. Lesions were easily identified using gradient-echo and spin-echo (SE) as well as diffusion images. MR imaging at 8T identified many of the types of plaques previously evident only by pathology. The magnitude of the cortical involvement in this 1 patient was severe. Lesions in the gray matter readily visible by high-field MR imaging were sometimes barely visible by pathology. MR imaging at 8T often facilitated the detection of such plaques by pathology.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: This study establishes the utility of high-field imaging at 8T in the delineation of plaques in the cerebral CGM in MS.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION$\backslash$nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become key in the diagnosis and disease monitoring of patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Both, T2 lesion load and Gadolinium (Gd) enhancing T1 lesions represent important endpoints in MS clinical trials by serving as a surrogate of clinical disease activity. T2- and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) lesion quantification - largely due to methodological constraints – is still being performed manually or in a semi-automated fashion, although strong efforts have been made to allow automated quantitative lesion segmentation. In 2012, Schmidt and co-workers published an algorithm to be applied on FLAIR sequences. The aim of this study was to apply the Schmidt algorithm on an independent data set and compare automated segmentation to inter-rater variability of three independent, experienced raters. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS$\backslash$nMRI data of 50 patients with RRMS were randomly selected from a larger pool of MS patients attending the MS Clinic at the Brain and Mind Centre, University of Sydney, Australia. MRIs were acquired on a 3.0T GE scanner (Discovery MR750, GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) using an 8 channel head coil. We determined T2-lesion load (total lesion volume and total lesion number) using three versions of an automated segmentation algorithm (Lesion growth algorithm (LGA) based on SPM8 or SPM12 and lesion prediction algorithm (LPA) based on SPM12) as first described by Schmidt et al. (2012). Additionally, manual segmentation was performed by three independent raters. We calculated inter-rater correlation coefficients (ICC) and dice coefficients (DC) for all possible pairwise comparisons. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS$\backslash$nWe found a strong correlation between manual and automated lesion segmentation based on LGA SPM8, regarding lesion volume (ICC=0.958 and DC=0.60) that was not statistically different from the inter-rater correlation (ICC=0.97 and DC=0.66). Correlation between the two other algorithms (LGA SPM12 and LPA SPM12) and manual raters was weaker but still adequate (ICC=0.927 and DC=0.53 for LGA SPM12 and ICC=0.949 and DC=0.57 for LPA SPM12). Variability of both manual and automated segmentation was significantly higher regarding lesion numbers. CONCLUSION: Automated lesion volume quantification can be applied reliably on FLAIR data sets using the SPM based algorithm of Schmidt et al. and shows good agreement with manual segmentation.},

abstract = {We present a novel and flexible approach to the problem of feature selection, called grafting.Rather than considering feature selection as separate from learning, grafting treats the selection of suitable features as an integral part of learning a predictor in a regularized learning framework. To make this regularized learning process sufficiently fast for large scale problems, grafting operates in an incremental iterative fashion, gradually building up a feature set while training a predictor model using gradient descent. At each iteration, a fast gradient-based heuristic is used to quickly assess which feature is most likely to improve the existing model, that feature is then added to the model, and the model is incrementally optimized using gradient descent. The algorithm scales linearly with the number of data points and at most quadratically with the number of features. Grafting can be used with a variety of predictor model classes, both linear and non-linear, and can be used for both classification and regression. Experiments are reported here on a variant of grafting for classification, using both linear and non-linear models, and using a logistic regression-inspired loss function. Results on a variety of synthetic and real world data sets are presented. Finally the relationship between grafting, stagewise additive modelling, and boosting is explored.},

abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common neurological disease which can cause loss of vision and balance, muscle weakness, impaired speech, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction and even paralysis. The key pathological processes in MS are inflammation, edema, myelin loss, axonal loss and gliosis. Unfortunately, the cause of MS is still not understood and there is currently no cure. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important clinical and research tool for MS. {\&}apos;Conventional{\&}apos; MRI images of MS brain reveal bright lesions, or plaques, which demark regions of severe tissue damage. Conventional MRI has been extremely valuable for the diagnosis and management of people who have MS and also for the assessment of therapies designed to reduce inflammation and promote repair. While conventional MRI is clearly valuable, it lack pathological specificity and, in some cases, sensitivity to non-lesional pathology. Advanced MR techniques have been developed to provide information that is more sensitive and specific than what is available with clinical scanning. Diffusion tensor imaging and magnetization transfer provide a general but non-specific measure of the pathological state of brain tissue. MR spectroscopy provides concentrations of brain metabolites which can be related to specific pathologies. Myelin water imaging was designed to assess brain myelination and has proved useful for measuring myelin loss in MS. To combat MS, it is crucial that the pharmaceutical industry finds therapies which can reverse the neurodegenerative processes which occur in the disease. The challenge for magnetic resonance researchers is to design imaging techniques which can provide detailed pathological information relating to the mechanisms of MS therapies. This paper briefly describes the pathologies of MS and demonstrates how MS-associated pathologies can be followed using both conventional and advanced MR imaging protocols.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: White matter lesions (WML) increase with age and are associated with stroke, cognitive decline and dementia. They can be visually rated or computationally assessed. METHODS: We compared WML Fazekas visual rating scores and volumes, determined using a validated multispectral image-fusion technique, in Magnetic Resonance Imaging from 672 participants of the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 and sought explanations for subjects in whom the correlation (Spearman's $\rho$) between the total Fazekas score (summed deep and periventricular ratings, 0-6) and WML volume did not concur (z-score difference {\textgreater}1). Infarcts were identified separately. RESULTS: The median WML Fazekas score was 2 [inter-quartile range (IQR): 2], median WML volume 7.7 ml (IQR: 13.6 ml) and median infarct volume (n = 95) 0.98 ml. Score and volume were highly correlated (Spearman's $\rho$ = 0.78, p {\textless} 0.001). Infarcts did not alter the correlation. Minor discordance occurred in 94/672 (14{\%}) subjects, most with total Fazekas score of 1 (n = 20, WML volume = 4.5-14.8 ml) or 2 (n = 50, WML volume = 0.1-34.4 ml). The main reasons were: subtle WML identified visually but omitted from the volume; prominent ventricular caps but thin body lining giving a periventricular score of 1/2 but large WML volume, and small deep focal lesions which increase the score disproportionally when beginning to coalesce with little change in WML volume. CONCLUSIONS: WML rating scores and volumes provide near-equivalent estimates of WML burden, therefore either can be used depending on research circumstances. Even closer agreement could result from improved computational detection of subtle WML and modified visual ratings to differentiate prominent ventricular caps from thin periventricular linings, and small non-coalescent from early coalescent deep WML.},

abstract = {Segmentation is an important step for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). This paper presents a new approach to the fully automatic segmentation of MS lesions in Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) Magnetic Resonance (MR) images. With the aim of increasing the contrast of the FLAIR MR images with respect to the MS lesions, the proposed method first estimates the fuzzy memberships of brain tissues (i.e., the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the normal-appearing brain tissue (NABT), and the lesion). The procedure for determining the fuzzy regions of their member functions is performed by maximizing fuzzy entropy through Genetic Algorithm. Research shows that the intersection points of the obtained membership functions are not accurate enough to segment brain tissues. Then, by extracting the structural similarity (SSIM) indices between the FLAIR MR image and its lesions membership image, a new contrast-enhanced image is created in which MS lesions have high contrast against other tissues. Finally, the new contrast-enhanced image is used to segment MS lesions. To evaluate the result of the proposed method, similarity criteria from all slices from 20 MS patients are calculated and compared with other methods, which include manual segmentation. The volume of segmented lesions is also computed and compared with Gold standard using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and paired samples t test. Similarity index for the patients with small lesion load, moderate lesion load and large lesion load was 0.7261, 0.7745 and 0.8231, respectively. The average overall similarity index for all patients is 0.7649. The t test result indicates that there is no statistically significant difference between the automatic and manual segmentation. The validated results show that this approach is very promising.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Multi-sequence magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a frequently used method for characterising and quantifying white matter (WM) lesions in the human brain. The number and size of lesions are commonly determined to assess the diseases in clinical settings. Accurate WM lesion segmentation is very important for disease diagnosis and progression surveillance. The goal of this paper is to present an approach for improving WM lesion segmentation accuracy. METHODS In this paper, we propose a novel method integrating the multi-sequence and spatial information in a Bayesian framework for WM lesion detection from multi-sequence human brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs). The entire framework is based on a three-step approach: First, a multinomial logistic regression (MLR) algorithm is used to assess the conditional probability distributions of intensities in WM lesions and brain tissues from training data. Second, the spatial information previously given by a Markov random field (MRF) prior is integrated with multimodal information in the Bayesian framework to strengthen the spatial constraint. This step is especially effective when WM lesions have intensity values similar to those of other brain tissues. Finally, a post-processing step based on biological knowledge is used to remove some false positives. RESULTS Our method is validated using two datasets. The experimental results show that our algorithm agrees well with manual expert labelling and indicate that our multimodal spatial-based method offers a significant advantage over other approaches. CONCLUSIONS A three-step approach for combining multimodal and spatial information is proposed for WM lesion segmentation. The advantages of this approach are discussed, and a practical application to two datasets is presented.},

abstract = {Atlas-based segmentation techniques are often employed to encode anatomical information for the delineation of multiple structures in magnetic resonance images of the brain. One of the primary challenges of these approaches is to efficiently model qualitative and quantitative anatomical knowledge without introducing a strong bias toward certain anatomical preferences when segmenting new images. This paper explores the use of topological information as a prior and proposes a segmentation framework based on both topological and statistical atlases of brain anatomy. Topology can be used to describe continuity of structures, as well as the relationships between structures, and is often a critical component in cortical surface reconstruction and deformation-based morphometry. Our method guarantees strict topological equivalence between the segmented image and the atlas, and relies only weakly on a statistical atlas of shape. Tissue classification and fast marching methods are used to provide a powerful and flexible framework to handle multiple image contrasts, high levels of noise, gain field inhomogeneities, and variable anatomies. The segmentation algorithm has been validated on simulated and real brain image data and made freely available to researchers. Our experiments demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the method and the limited influence of the statistical atlas. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The design of a double inversion recovery (DIR) sequence, to image selectively grey or white brain matter, is described. Suitable choice of inversion times allows either cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and white matter to be suppressed, to image the cortex alone, or CSF and grey matter to be suppressed, to image the white matter. The DIR sequence was found to give clear delineation of the cerebral cortex. Inversion recovery (IR) sequences can be used to null the signal of a single tissue by appropriate choice of the inversion interval TI. For the case where the z -magne-tization is fully recovered this is: TI = In 2 • r, where T x is the tissue's longitudinal relaxation time. The most common example of this is the STIR sequence [1], where TI is chosen to suppress fat. The use of an additional inversion pulse allows two tissues (e.g. fat and fluid) to be nulled simultaneously, and is termed a double inversion recovery (DIR) se-quence [1]. This works best if they have very different relaxation times. Figure 1 outlines a simple explanation of the DIR sequence applied to nulling cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and white matter signals. In the interval TI, between the inverting pulses, brain tissue magnetization recovers almost fully, while CSF, with its substantially longer T x , recovers to only a small fraction of M o , the equilibrium magnetization. The second inversion inter-val TI 2 is chosen to null white matter magnetization. Grey matter, with a longer 7$\backslash$, remains negative and generates a signal. CSF magnetization recovers slowly to pass through the null point at the same time as white matter. The morphology of the brain is complex. In the sulci, for instance, the complex folds can mean that all three tissues (grey and white matter, and CSF) can lie within the same voxel. Methods of segmentation (e.g. [2]), are based on computer analysis of differences in image intensity caused by differences in relaxation times and proton density between tissues. The DIR technique offers a method of segmenting the brain directly, without},

abstract = {Purpose: To explore relations between spatial distribution of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions, and disability. In MS, the presence of asymptomatic brain lesions challenges the pre- diction of disability based on conventional brain MRI. Hy- pothesizing that symptomatology may partly be deter- mined by lesion location, this retrospective study explored relations between lesion location and disability using vox- elwise analyses in standard space. Materials and Methods: Using nonparametric permuta- tion-based statistics, voxelwise lesion probability on T2 le- sion masks was related to expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and MS functional composite (MSFC) subdomain scores and demographic characteristics of 325 MS pa- tients. To identify statistically significant locations, a clus- ter-forming threshold of 3.1 was used. Results: In clusters in the periventricular region, lesion probability correlated significantly (P ? 0.001) with disabil- ity and disease duration, and was higher in progressive than in relapsing disease. When controlled for lesion load (LL), no significant clusters survived. Presence and number of spinal cord lesions did not correlate with lesion proba- bility in any location, and did not influence correlations with disability when included in its analyses. Conclusion: Periventricular lesions were related to disabil- ity. LL influenced relations between disability and lesion probability throughout the brain, suggesting interplay be- tween lesional burden and its location in determining dis- ability in MS.},

abstract = {A fully automated brain tissue segmentation method is optimized and extended with white matter lesion segmentation. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) are segmented by an atlas-based k-nearest neighbor classifier on multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging data. This classifier is trained by registering brain atlases to the subject. The resulting GM segmentation is used to automatically find a white matter lesion (WML) threshold in a fluid-attenuated inversion recovery scan. False positive lesions are removed by ensuring that the lesions are within the white matter. The method was visually validated on a set of 209 subjects. No segmentation errors were found in 98{\%} of the brain tissue segmentations and 97{\%} of the WML segmentations. A quantitative evaluation using manual segmentations was performed on a subset of 6 subjects for CSF, GM and WM segmentation and an additional 14 for the WML segmentations. The results indicated that the automatic segmentation accuracy is close to the interobserver variability of manual segmentations.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an ever-expanding role in the evaluation of multiple sclerosis (MS). This includes its sensitivity for the diagnosis of the disease and its role in identifying patients at high risk for conversion to MS after a first presentation with selected clinically isolated syndromes. In addition, MRI is a key tool in providing primary therapeutic outcome measures for phase I/II trials and secondary outcome measures in phase III trials. The utility of MRI stems from its sensitivity to longitudinal changes including those in overt lesions and, with advanced MRI techniques, in areas affected by diffuse occult disease (the so-called normal-appearing brain tissue). However, all current MRI methodology suffers from limited specificity for the underlying histopathology. Conventional MRI techniques, including lesion detection and measurement of atrophy from T1- or T2-weighted images, have been the mainstay for monitoring disease activity in clinical trials, in which the use of gadolinium with T1-weighted images adds additional sensitivity and specificity for areas of acute inflammation. Advanced imaging methods including magnetization transfer, fluid attenuated inversion recovery, diffusion, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, functional MRI, and nuclear imaging techniques have added to our understanding of the pathogenesis of MS and may provide methods to monitor therapies more sensitively in the future. However, these advanced methods are limited by their cost, availability, complexity, and lack of validation. In this article, we review the role of conventional and advanced imaging techniques with an emphasis on neurotherapeutics.},

Multichannel magnetic resonance images are used to delineate multiple sclerosis lesions while segmenting the brain into its major structures. The method is an atlas-based segmentation technique employing a topological atlas as well as a statistical atlas. An advantage of this approach is that all segmented structures are topologically constrained, thereby allowing subsequent processing such as cortical unfolding or diffeomorphic shape analysis techniques. Evaluation with both simulated and real data sets demonstrates that the method has an accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art MS lesion segmentation methods, while simultaneously segmenting the whole brain.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: With the objective of bringing clinical decision support systems to reality, this article reviews histopathological whole-slide imaging informatics methods, associated challenges, and future research opportunities.

TARGET AUDIENCE: This review targets pathologists and informaticians who have a limited understanding of the key aspects of whole-slide image (WSI) analysis and/or a limited knowledge of state-of-the-art technologies and analysis methods.

SCOPE: First, we discuss the importance of imaging informatics in pathology and highlight the challenges posed by histopathological WSI. Next, we provide a thorough review of current methods for: quality control of histopathological images; feature extraction that captures image properties at the pixel, object, and semantic levels; predictive modeling that utilizes image features for diagnostic or prognostic applications; and data and information visualization that explores WSI for de novo discovery. In addition, we highlight future research directions and discuss the impact of large public repositories of histopathological data, such as the Cancer Genome Atlas, on the field of pathology informatics. Following the review, we present a case study to illustrate a clinical decision support system that begins with quality control and ends with predictive modeling for several cancer endpoints. Currently, state-of-the-art software tools only provide limited image processing capabilities instead of complete data analysis for clinical decision-making. We aim to inspire researchers to conduct more research in pathology imaging informatics so that clinical decision support can become a reality.},

abstract = {The exquisite soft tissue contrast provided by magnetic resonance imaging arises principally from differences in the intrinsic relaxation properties, T1 and T2. Although the intricate relationships that link tissue microstructure and the longitudinal and transverse relaxation times remain to be firmly established, quantitative measurement of these parameters, also referred to as quantitative relaxometry, can be informative of disease-related tissue change, developmental plasticity, and other biological processes. Further, relaxometry studies potentially offer a more detailed characterization of tissue, compared with conventional qualitative or weighted imaging approaches.The purposes of this review were to briefly review the biophysical basis of relaxation, focusing specifically on the T1, T2, and T2* relaxation times, and to detail some of the more widely used and clinically feasible techniques for their in vivo measurement. We will focus on neuroimaging applications, although the methods described are equally well suited to cardiac, abdominal, and musculoskeletal imaging. Potential sources of error, and methods for their correction, are also touched on. Finally, the combination of relaxation time data with other complementary quantitative imaging data, including diffusion tensor imaging, is discussed, with the aim of more thoroughly characterizing brain tissue.},

However, mitosis counting is laborious, subjective and may suffer from low inter-observer agreement. With the wider acceptance of whole slide images in pathology labs, automatic image analysis has been proposed as a potential solution for these issues. In this paper, the results from the Assessment of Mitosis Detection Algorithms 2013 (AMIDA13) challenge are described. The challenge was based on a data set consisting of 12 training and 11 testing subjects, with more than one thousand annotated mitotic figures by multiple observers. Short descriptions and results from the evaluation of eleven methods are presented. The top performing method has an error rate that is comparable to the inter-observer agreement among pathologists.},

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for automatic segmentation of MS lesions from multi-channel MR images (T1W, T2W and FLAIR images). The proposed method is an extension of Li et al.'s algorithm in [1], which only segments the normal tissues from T1W images. The proposed method is aimed to segment MS lesions, while normal tissues are also segmented and bias field is estimated to handle intensity inhomogeneities in the images. Another contribution of this paper is the introduction of a nonlocal means technique to achieve spatially regularized segmentation, which overcomes the influence of noise. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed algorithm. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Most MS patients follow a relapsing-remitting (RR-MS) course for 10 to 15 years that transforms into a chronic or secondary progressive disease (SP-MS). This review summarizes studies from our laboratory that implicate activated microglia and astrocytes in early stages of myelin destruction in MS brain. In addition, we review evidence that indicates that axonal transection is a major pathological process in multiple sclerosis. Our data support the hypothesis that neurological disability in RR-MS is due to inflammatory demyelination while axonal loss plays a significant role in the irreversible neurological decline in SP-MS. Further elucidation of the pathological targets and pathological mechanisms of tissue destruction in MS brain will help identify new therapeutics. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {The association between common neuroradiological markers of multiple sclerosis (MS) and clinical disability is weak, a phenomenon known as the clinico-radiological paradox. Here, we investigated to which degree it is possible to predict individual disease profiles from conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using multivariate analysis algorithms. Specifically, we conducted cross-validated canonical correlation analyses to investigate the predictive information contained in conventional MRI data of 40 MS patients for the following clinical parameters: disease duration, motor disability (9-Hole Peg Test, Timed 25-Foot Walk Test), cognitive dysfunction (Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test), and the expanded disability status scale (EDSS). It turned out that the information in the spatial patterning of MRI data predicted the clinical scores with correlations of up to 0.80 (p {\textless} 10(-9)). Maximal predictive information for disease duration was identified in the precuneus and somatosensory cortex. Areas in the precuneus and precentral gyrus were maximally informative for motor disability. Cognitive dysfunction could best be predicted using data from the angular gyrus and superior parietal lobe. For EDSS, the inferior frontal gyrus was maximally informative. In conclusion, conventional MRI is highly predictive of clinical disability in MS when pattern-based algorithms are used for prediction. Thus, the so-called clinico-radiological paradox is not apparent when using suitable analysis techniques.},

The displacement fields are modelled as linear combinations of basis-functions, which may be the discrete Cosine transform (DCT) or cubic B-splines placed on a regular grid. Regularisation of the field is based on membrane energy. At present the registration is based on a weighted sum of scaled sum-of-squared differences and mebrane energy. Great effort has been placed on the optimisation, and on providing computational tools to enable robust and rapid convergence even for relatively high resolution of the warps. The results that are presented are based on a multi-scale Levenberg-Marquardt minimisation. The registration is initialised and run to convergence with sub-sampled images, a field of low resolution and a high regularisation weight. The images and the fields from the first step are then up-sampled, the regularisation modified and it is again run to convergence. This is repeated until the required warp-resolution and level of regularisation is achieved.

The approach stresses testing on a large number of images of the same type, and exploiting the special characteristics of this type of images. The system was designed with the variations of the various image parameters in mind, to ensure its reliability. New low-level methods of high reliability have been developed for segmenting images.

abstract = {Over the last few years, the increasing interest in brain tissue volume measurements on clinical settings has led to the development of a wide number of automated tissue segmentation methods. However, white matter lesions are known to reduce the performance of automated tissue segmentation methods, which requires manual annotation of the lesions and refilling them before segmentation, which is tedious and time-consuming. Here, we propose a new, fully automated T1-w/FLAIR tissue segmentation approach designed to deal with images in the presence of WM lesions. This approach integrates a robust partial volume tissue segmentation with WM outlier rejection and filling, combining intensity and probabilistic and morphological prior maps. We evaluate the performance of this method on the MRBrainS13 tissue segmentation challenge database, which contains images with vascular WM lesions, and also on a set of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patient images. On both databases, we validate the performance of our method with other state-of-the-art techniques. On the MRBrainS13 data, the presented approach was at the time of submission the best ranked unsupervised intensity model method of the challenge (7th position) and clearly outperformed the other unsupervised pipelines such as FAST and SPM12. On MS data, the differences in tissue segmentation between the images segmented with our method and the same images where manual expert annotations were used to refill lesions on T1-w images before segmentation were lower or similar to the best state-of-the-art pipeline incorporating automated lesion segmentation and filling. Our results show that the proposed pipeline achieved very competitive results on both vascular and MS lesions. A public version of this approach is available to download for the neuro-imaging community.},

Exactly as for classical sets, there exist operators, relations, and mappings appropriate for these fuzzy sets. This paper presents the concepts of fuzzy sets, operations, relations, and mappings in an ecological context. Fuzzy set theory is then established as a theoretical basis for ordination, and is employed in a sequence of examples in an analysis of forest vegetation of western Montana, U.S.A. The example ordinations show how site characteristics can be analyzed for their effect on vegetation composition, and how different site factors can be synthesized into complex environmental factors using the calculus of fuzzy set theory. In contrast to current ordination methods, ordinations based on fuzzy set theory require the investigator to hypothesize an ecological relationship between vegetation and environment, or between different vegetation compositions, before constructing the ordination. The plotted ordination is then viewed as evidence to corroborate or discredit the hypothesis.},

abstract = {A better understanding of the pathological mechanisms that drive neurodegeneration in individuals with multiple sclerosis is needed to develop therapies that will effectively treat patients in the primary and secondary progressive stages of the disease. We propose that the inflammatory demyelinating disease process in early multiple sclerosis triggers a cascade of events that lead to neurodegeneration and are amplified by pathogenic mechanisms related to brain ageing and accumulated disease burden. Key elements driving neurodegeneration include microglia activation, chronic oxidative injury, accumulation of mitochondrial damage in axons, and age-related iron accumulation in the human brain. Altered mitochondrial function in axons might be of particular importance. This process leads to chronic cell stress and imbalance of ionic homoeostasis, resulting in axonal and neuronal death. The evidence suggests that treatment of progressive multiple sclerosis should be based on a combination of anti-inflammatory, regenerative, and neuroprotective strategies.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Automatic brain-lesion segmentation has the potential to greatly expand the analysis of the relationships between brain function and lesion locations in large-scale epidemiologic studies, such as the ACCORD-MIND study. In this manuscript we describe the design and evaluation of a Bayesian lesion-segmentation method, with the expectation that our approach would segment white-matter brain lesions in MR images without user intervention. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Each ACCORD-MIND subject has T1-weighted, T2-weighted, spin-density-weighted, and FLAIR sequences. The training portion of our algorithm first registers training images to a standard coordinate space; then, it collects statistics that capture signal-intensity information, and residual spatial variability of normal structures and lesions. The classification portion of our algorithm then uses these statistics to segment lesions in images from new subjects, without the need for user intervention. We evaluated this algorithm using 42 subjects with primarily white-matter lesions from the ACCORD-MIND project. RESULTS: Our experiments demonstrated high classification accuracy, using an expert neuroradiologist as a standard. CONCLUSIONS: A Bayesian lesion-segmentation algorithm that collects multi-channel signal-intensity and spatial information from MR images of the brain shows potential for accurately segmenting brain lesions in images obtained from subjects not used in training.},

DJ-1 was reported to be a multifunctional oxidative stress response protein with poorly defined function. Here, we show that human DJ-1 is a protein deglycase that repairs methylglyoxal- and glyoxal-glycated amino acids and proteins by acting on early glycation intermediates and releases repaired proteins and lactate or glycolate, respectively. DJ-1 deglycates cysteines, arginines, and lysines (the three major glycated amino acids) of serum albumin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, aldolase, and aspartate aminotransferase and thus reactivates these proteins. DJ-1 prevented protein glycation in an Escherichia coli mutant deficient in the DJ-1 homolog YajL and restored cell viability in glucose-containing media. These results suggest that DJ-1-associated Parkinsonism results from excessive protein glycation and establishes DJ-1 as a major anti-glycation and anti-aging protein.},

The most common method used is the H-score which takes into consideration the staining intensity in conjunction with the percentage of cells staining positively in breast carcinoma tissue. A "quickscore" has been developed which dispenses with the need to count individual cells. The quantitative biochemical Abbott enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and the Dako immunohistochemical assay (IHA) incorporating a semiquantitative H-score, have been used as standards against which the IHA quickscore for the semiquantitation of oestrogen receptor expression was tested. A good correlation was found between the quickscore and the EIA, which was as good as that between the H-score and EIA. The quickscore is a valid approach and there is no advantage in using the more rigorous H-score. A positive cut off quickscore of {\textgreater} or = 3 has been suggested.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS), the most important therapeutic aim of disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) is to prevent or postpone long-term disability. Given the typically slow progression observed in the majority of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients, the primary endpoint for most randomized clinical trials (RCTs) is a reduction in relapse rate. It is widely assumed that reducing relapse rate will slow disability progression. Similarly, MRI studies suggest that reducing T2 lesions will be associated with slowing long-term disability in MS. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between treatment effects on relapse rates and active T2 lesions to differences in disease progression (as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS]) in trials evaluating patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), RRMS, and secondary progressive MS (SPMS).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted in Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, and PsycINFO to identify randomized trials published in English from January 1, 1993-June 3, 2013 evaluating DMTs in adult MS patients using keywords for CIS, RRMS, and SPMS combined with keywords for relapse and recurrence. Eligible studies were required to report outcomes of relapse and T2 lesion changes or disease progression in CIS, RRMS, or SPMS patients receiving DMTs and have a follow-up duration of at least 22 months. Ultimately, 40 studies satisfied these criteria for inclusion. Regression analyses were conducted on RCTs to relate differences between the effect of treatments on relapse rates and on active T2 lesions to differences between the effects of treatments on disease progression (as measured by EDSS).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Regression analysis determined there is a substantive clinically and statistically significant association between concurrent treatment effects in relapse rate and EDSS; p {\textless} 0.01. Lower treatment effects were associated with higher relative rates of disease progression. Significant associations between T2 lesion measures and EDSS measures also were found (p {\textless} 0.05), with some suggestion that the strength of the association may differ for older versus newer DMTs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Treatment differences in relapse reduction and T2 lesions are positively related to differences in disease progression over the first two years of treatment.},

abstract = {A hallmark of the Alzheimer disease (AD) brain is the presence of inclusions within neurons that are comprised of fibrils formed from the microtubule-stabilizing protein tau. The formation of misfolded multimeric tau species is believed to contribute to the progressive neuron loss and cognitive impairments of AD. Moreover, mutations in tau have been shown to cause a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration in which tau neuronal inclusions observed in the brain are similar to those seen in AD. Here we review the more compelling strategies that are designed to reduce the contribution of misfolded tau to AD neuropathology, including those directed at correcting a possible loss of tau function resulting from sequestration of cellular tau and to minimizing possible gain-of-function toxicities caused by multimeric tau species. Finally, we discuss the challenges and potential benefits of tau-directed drug discovery programs.},

abstract = {Finite mixture models (FMMs) are an indispensable tool for unsupervised classification in brain imaging. Fitting an FMM to the data leads to a complex optimization problem. This optimization problem is difficult to solve by standard local optimization methods, such as the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, if a principled initialization is not available. In this paper, we propose a new global optimization algorithm for the FMM parameter estimation problem, which is based on real coded genetic algorithms. Our specific contributions are two-fold: 1) we propose to use blended crossover in order to reduce the premature convergence problem to its minimum and 2) we introduce a completely new permutation operator specifically meant for the FMM parameter estimation. In addition to improving the optimization results, the permutation operator allows for imposing biologically meaningful constraints to the FMM parameter values. We also introduce a hybrid of the genetic algorithm and the EM algorithm for efficient solution of multidimensional FMM fitting problems. We compare our algorithm to the self-annealing EM-algorithm and a standard real coded genetic algorithm with the voxel classification tasks within the brain imaging. The algorithms are tested on synthetic data as well as real three-dimensional image data from human magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and mouse brain MRI. The tissue classification results by our method are shown to be consistently more reliable and accurate than with the competing parameter estimation methods.},

We sought to localize perfusion distribution differences in patients with relapsing-remitting MS with and without cognitive impairment and healthy controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty-nine patients with relapsing-remitting MS (20 cognitively impaired, 19 nonimpaired) and 19 age- and sex-matched healthy controls underwent a neurocognitive battery and MR imaging. Voxel-based analysis compared regional deep and cortical GM perfusion and volume among the cohorts. RESULTS After we adjusted for localized volumetric differences in the right frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes, progressive CBF and CBV deficits were present in the left middle frontal cortex for all cohorts and in the left superior frontal gyrus for patients with cognitive impairment compared with patients without impairment and controls. Compared with healthy controls, reduced CBF was present in the limbic regions of patients with cognitive impairment, and reduced CBV was present in the right middle frontal gyrus in patients with cognitive impairment and in the temporal gyrus of relapsing-remitting MS patients without cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS Consistent regional frontal cortical perfusion deficits are present in patients with relapsing-remitting MS, with more widespread hypoperfusion in those with cognitive impairment, independent of structural differences, indicating that cortical perfusion may be a useful biomarker of cortical dysfunction and cognitive impairment in MS.},

abstract = {Focused ultrasound (FUS) phased arrays show promise for non-invasive brain therapy. However, the majority of them are limited to a single transmit/receive frequency and therefore lack the versatility to expose and monitor the treatment volume. Multi-frequency arrays could offer variable transmit focal sizes under a fixed aperture, and detect different spectral content on receive for imaging purposes. Here, a three-frequency (306, 612, and 1224 kHz) sparse hemispherical ultrasound phased array (31.8 cm aperture; 128 transducer modules) was constructed and evaluated for microbubble-mediated transcranial therapy and simultaneous cavitation mapping. The array is able to perform effective electronic beam steering over a volume spanning (−40, 40) and (−30, 50) mm in the lateral and axial directions, respectively. The focal size at the geometric center is approximately 0.9 (2.1) mm, 1.7 (3.9) mm, and 3.1 (6.5) mm in lateral (axial) pressure full width at half maximum (FWHM) at 1224, 612, and 306 kHz, respectively. The array was also found capable of dual-frequency excitation and simultaneous multi-foci sonication, which enables the future exploration of more complex exposure strategies. Passive acoustic mapping of dilute microbubble clouds demonstrated that the point spread function of the receive array has a lateral (axial) intensity FWHM between 0.8–3.5 mm (1.7–11.7 mm) over a volume spanning (−25, 25) mm in both the lateral and axial directions, depending on the transmit/receive frequency combination and the imaging location. The device enabled both half and second harmonic imaging through the intact skull, which may be useful for improving the contrast-to-tissue ratio or imaging resolution, respectively. Preliminary in vivo experiments demonstrated the system's ability to induce blood–brain barrier opening and simultaneously spatially map microbubble cavitation activity in a rat model. This work presents a tool to investigate optimal strategies for non-thermal FUS brain therapy and concurrent microbubble cavitation monitoring through the availability of multiple frequencies.},

abstract = {Accurate characterization of white-matter lesions from magnetic resonance (MR) images has increasing importance for diagnosis and management of treatment of certain neurological diseases, and can be performed in an objective and effective way by automated lesion segmentation. This usually involves modeling the whole-brain MR intensity distribution, however, capturing various sources of MR intensity variability and lesion heterogeneity results in highly complex whole-brain MR intensity models, thus their robust estimation on a large set of MR images presents a huge challenge. We propose a novel approach employing stratified mixture modeling, where the main premise is that the otherwise complex whole-brain model can be reduced to a tractable parametric form in small brain subregions. We show on MR images of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with different lesion loads that robust estimators enable accurate mixture modeling of MR intensity in small brain subregions even in the presence of lesions. Recombination of the mixture models across strata provided an accurate whole-brain MR intensity model. Increasing the number of subregions and, thereby, the model complexity, consistently improved the accuracy of whole-brain MR intensity modeling and segmentation of normal structures. The proposed approach was incorporated into three unsupervised lesion segmentation methods and, compared to original and three other state-of-the-art methods, the proposed modeling approach significantly improved lesion segmentation according to increased Dice similarity indices and lower number of false positives on real MR images of 30 patients with MS.},

abstract = {While computed tomography and other imaging techniques are measured in absolute units with physical meaning, magnetic resonance images are expressed in arbitrary units that are difficult to interpret and differ between study visits and subjects. Much work in the image processing literature on intensity normalization has focused on histogram matching and other histogram mapping techniques, with little emphasis on normalizing images to have biologically interpretable units. Furthermore, there are no formalized principles or goals for the crucial comparability of image intensities within and across subjects. To address this, we propose a set of criteria necessary for the normalization of images. We further propose simple and robust biologically motivated normalization techniques for multisequence brain imaging that have the same interpretation across acquisitions and satisfy the proposed criteria. We compare the performance of different normalization methods in thousands of images of patients with Alzheimer's disease, hundreds of patients with multiple sclerosis, and hundreds of healthy subjects obtained in several different studies at dozens of imaging centers. ?? 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate brain tissue segmentation from magnetic resonance (MR) images is an important step in analysis of cerebral images. There are software packages which are used for brain segmentation. These packages usually contain a set of skull stripping, intensity non-uniformity (bias) correction and segmentation routines. Thus, assessment of the quality of the segmented gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is needed for the neuroimaging applications. METHODS: In this paper, performance evaluation of three widely used brain segmentation software packages SPM8, FSL and Brainsuite is presented. Segmentation with SPM8 has been performed in three frameworks: i) default segmentation, ii) SPM8 New-segmentation and iii) modified version using hidden Markov random field as implemented in SPM8-VBM toolbox. RESULTS: The accuracy of the segmented GM, WM and CSF and the robustness of the tools against changes of image quality has been assessed using Brainweb simulated MR images and IBSR real MR images. The calculated similarity between the segmented tissues using different tools and corresponding ground truth shows variations in segmentation results. CONCLUSION: A few studies has investigated GM, WM and CSF segmentation. In these studies, the skull stripping and bias correction are performed separately and they just evaluated the segmentation. Thus, in this study, assessment of complete segmentation framework consisting of pre-processing and segmentation of these packages is performed. The obtained results can assist the users in choosing an appropriate segmentation software package for the neuroimaging application of interest.},

abstract = {Nearest-neighbor inference methods have been widely and successfully used in numerous applications such as forecasting which news topics will go viral, recommending products to people in online stores, and delineating objects in images by looking at image patches. However, there is little theoretical understanding of when, why, and how well these nonparametric inference methods work in terms of key problem-specific quantities relevant to practitioners. This thesis bridges the gap between theory and practice for these methods in the three specific case studies of time series classification, online collaborative filtering, and patch-based image segmentation. To do so, for each of these problems, we prescribe a probabilistic model in which the data appear generated from unknown “latent sources” that capture salient structure in the problem. These latent source models naturally lead to nearest-neighbor or nearest-neighbor-like inference methods similar to ones already used in practice. We derive theoretical performance guarantees for these methods, relating inference quality to the amount of training data available and problemspecific structure modeled by the latent sources.},

In this review, we assessed the current literature about the hypothesis that wake-up-strokes occur just prior on awakening and if this subgroup differs in characteristics compared to the overall stroke population. We looked at the safety and efficacy of thrombolysis and interventional techniques in the group of patients with unknown stroke-onset. We performed a meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of the diffusion-FLAIR mismatch in identifying stroke within 3 and 4.5 h. The different imaging-selection criteria that can be used to treat these patients are discussed.

abstract = {The interobserver reproducibility of the Nottingham modification of the Bloom and Richardson histologic grading scheme for invasive breast carcinoma was tested. Six surgical pathologists from four institutions independently evaluated histologic grade and each of its three components for 75 infiltrating ductal carcinomas. The number of slides per case ranged from one to nine (median 3). Pairwise kappa values for agreement ranged from moderate to substantial (0.43-0.74) for histologic grade. Generalized kappa values indicated substantial agreement for tubule formation (0.64), moderate agreement for mitotic count (0.52), and near moderate agreement for nuclear pleomorphism (0.40). Normalizing the mitotic counts per mm2 showed only slight improvement in agreement over the published range of mitotic counts for three different field areas. The results suggest that steps to discriminate between categories for nuclear pleomorphism would likely be of benefit for improving the interobserver reproducibility of histologic grade. Nevertheless, the Nottingham modification of the Bloom and Richardson grading system is recommended as a suitable scheme for evaluating invasive breast carcinomas in the routine clinical setting.},

Four types of MRI-defined regions of interest (ROIs) were analyzed: (1) regions that were abnormal on all images (T2T1MTR lesions); (2) NAWM regions with slightly abnormal MTR located close to white matter lesions (sa-WM Close); (3) NAWM regions with slightly abnormal MTR located far from lesions (sa-WM Far); and (4) NAWM regions with normal MTR (NAWM). Immunohistochemical analysis for each ROI comprised immunostaining for myelin, axonal markers, activated microglia/macrophages, astrocytes, plasma proteins, and blood vessels.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Forty-eight ROIs from 4 secondary progressive MS brains were analyzed. sa-WM Close ROIs were associated with significantly more axonal swellings. There were more enlarged major histocompatibility complex II(+) microglia and macrophages detected in sa-WM Far, sa-WM Close, and T2T1MTR lesions than in NAWM. Across all ROIs, MTR and DTI measures were moderately correlated with myelin density, axonal area, and axonal counts. Excluding T2T1MTR lesions from analysis revealed that MTR and DTI measures in nonlesional white matter (WM) were correlated with activated microglia, but not with axonal or myelin integrity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nINTERPRETATION: The pathologic substrates for MRI abnormalities in NAWM vary based on distance from focal WM lesions. Close to WM lesions, axonal pathology and microglial activation may explain subtle MRI changes. Distant from lesions, microglial activation associated with proximity to cortical lesions might underlie MRI abnormalities.},

Accurate and reproducible automatic segmentation of WMHs is important since WMHs are often seen in the elderly and are associated with various geriatric and psychiatric disorders.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We developed a fully automated monospectral segmentation method for WMHs using FLAIR MRIs. Through this method, we introduce an optimal threshold intensity (I O ) for segmenting WMHs, which varies with WMHs volume (V WMH), and we establish the I O -V WMH relationship.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Our method showed accurate validations in volumetric and spatial agreements of automatically segmented WMHs compared with manually segmented WMHs for 32 confirmatory images. Bland-Altman values of volumetric agreement were 0.96 ± 8.311 ml (bias and 95 {\%} confidence interval), and the similarity index of spatial agreement was 0.762 ± 0.127 (mean ± standard deviation). Furthermore, similar validation accuracies were obtained in the images acquired from different scanners.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The proposed segmentation method uses only FLAIR MRIs, has the potential to be accurate with images obtained from different scanners, and can be implemented with a fully automated procedure. In our study, validation results were obtained with FLAIR MRIs from only two scanner types. The design of the method may allow its use in large multicenter studies with correct efficiency.},

abstract = {Whole brain computed tomography perfusion (CTP) has the potential to select eligible patients for reperfusion therapy. We aimed to find the optimal thresholds on baseline CTP for ischemic core and penumbra in acute ischemic stroke. We reviewed patients with acute ischemic stroke in the anterior circulation, who underwent baseline whole brain CTP, followed by intravenous thrombolysis and perfusion imaging at 24 hours. Patients were divided into those with major reperfusion (to define the ischemic core) and minimal reperfusion (to define the extent of penumbra). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and volumetric consistency analysis were performed separately to determine the optimal threshold by Youden's Index and mean magnitude of volume difference, respectively. From a series of 103 patients, 22 patients with minimal-reperfusion and 47 with major reperfusion were included. Analysis revealed delay time ≥ 3 s most accurately defined penumbra (AUC = 0.813; 95{\%} CI, 0.812-0.814, mean magnitude of volume difference = 29.1 ml). The optimal threshold for ischemic core was rCBF ≤ 30{\%} within delay time ≥ 3 s (AUC = 0.758; 95{\%} CI, 0.757-0.760, mean magnitude of volume difference = 10.8 ml). In conclusion, delay time ≥ 3 s and rCBF ≤ 30{\%} within delay time ≥ 3 s are the optimal thresholds for penumbra and core, respectively. These results may allow the application of the mismatch on CTP to reperfusion therapy.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop a method to automatically detect multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions, located both in white matter (WM) and in the cortex, in patients with low disability and early disease stage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a lesion detection method, based on the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) technique, to detect lesions as small as 0.0036 mL. This method uses the image intensity information from up to four different 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences (magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo, MPRAGE; magnetization-prepared two inversion-contrast rapid gradient-echo, MP2RAGE; 3D fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, FLAIR; and 3D double-inversion recovery, DIR), acquired on a 3T scanner. To these intensity features we added the information obtained by the spatial coordinates and tissue prior probabilities provided by the International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM). Quantitative assessment was done in 39 early-stage MS patients with a "leave-one-out" cross-validation. RESULTS: The best lesion detection rate (DR) performance in WM was obtained using MP2RAGE, FLAIR, and DIR intensities (77{\%} for lesions ≥0.0036 mL; 85{\%} for lesions ≥0.005 mL). Similar results were obtained excluding the DIR intensity as well as when using only MPRAGE and FLAIR (DR = 75{\%}, P = 0.5720). However, the combination of FLAIR with DIR and MP2RAGE appeared to be the best for detecting cortical lesions (DR = 62{\%}), compared to the other combination of sequences (P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSION: For WM lesion detection, similar results were observed when only conventional clinical sequences (FLAIR, MPRAGE) were used compared to a combination of conventional and "advanced" sequences (MP2RAGE, DIR). Cortical lesion detection increased significantly when "advanced" sequences were used. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2015.},

abstract = {T2* relaxation refers to decay of transverse magnetization caused by a combination of spin-spin relaxation and magnetic field inhomogeneity. T2* relaxation is seen only with gradient-echo (GRE) imaging because transverse relaxation caused by magnetic field inhomogeneities is eliminated by the 180 degrees pulse at spin-echo imaging. T2* relaxation is one of the main determinants of image contrast with GRE sequences and forms the basis for many magnetic resonance (MR) applications, such as susceptibility-weighted (SW) imaging, perfusion MR imaging, and functional MR imaging. GRE sequences can be made predominantly T2* weighted by using a low flip angle, long echo time, and long repetition time. GRE sequences with T2*-based contrast are used to depict hemorrhage, calcification, and iron deposition in various tissues and lesions. SW imaging uses phase information in addition to T2*-based contrast to exploit the magnetic susceptibility differences of the blood and of iron and calcification in various tissues. Perfusion MR imaging exploits the signal intensity decrease that occurs with the passage of a high concentration of gadopentetate dimeglumine through the microvasculature. Change in oxygen saturation during specific tasks changes the local T2*, which leads to the blood oxygen level-dependent effect seen at functional MR imaging. The basics of T2* relaxation, T2*-weighted sequences, and their clinical applications are presented, followed by the principles, techniques, and clinical uses of four T2*-based applications, including SW imaging, perfusion MR imaging, functional MR imaging, and iron overload imaging},

abstract = {Motion correction in magnetic resonance imaging by real-time adjustment of the imaging pulse sequence was first proposed more than 20 years ago. Recent advances have resulted from combining real-time correction with new navigator and external tracking mechanisms capable of quantifying rigid-body motion in all 6 degrees of freedom. The technique is now often referred to as "prospective motion correction." This article describes the fundamentals of prospective motion correction and reviews the latest developments in its application to brain imaging and spectroscopy. Although emphasis is placed on the brain as the organ of interest, the same principles apply whenever the imaged object can be approximated as a rigid body. Prospective motion correction can be used with most MR sequences, so it has potential to make a large impact in clinical routine. To maximize the benefits obtained from the technique, there are, however, several challenges still to be met. These include practical implementation issues, such as obtaining tracking data with minimal delay, and more fundamental problems, such as the magnetic field distortions caused by a moving object. This review discusses these challenges and summarizes the state of the art. We hope that this work will motivate further developments in prospective motion correction and help the technique to reach its full potential.},

abstract = {Morphological assessment of the degree of differentiation has been shown in numerous studies to provide useful prognostic information in breast cancer, but until recently histological grading has not been accepted as a routine procedure, mainly because of perceived problems with reproducibility and consistency. In the Nottingham/Tenovus Primary Breast Cancer Study the most commonly used method, described by Bloom {\&} Richardson, has been modified in order to make the criteria more objective. The revised technique involves semiquantitative evaluation of three morphological features--the percentage of tubule formation, the degree of nuclear pleomorphism and an accurate mitotic count using a defined field area. A numerical scoring system is used and the overall grade is derived from a summation of individual scores for the three variables: three grades of differentiation are used. Since 1973, over 2200 patients with primary operable breast cancer have been entered into a study of multiple prognostic factors. Histological grade, assessed in 1831 patients, shows a very strong correlation with prognosis; patients with grade I tumours have a significantly better survival than those with grade II and III tumours (P less than 0.0001). These results demonstrate that this method for histological grading provides important prognostic information and, if the grading protocol is followed consistently, reproducible results can be obtained. Histological grade forms part of the multifactorial Nottingham prognostic index, together with tumour size and lymph node stage, which is used to stratify individual patients for appropriate therapy.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES To investigate whether multiple sclerosis (MS) and non-MS white matter brain lesions can be distinguished by their appearance on 7 T T2*-weighted MRI. METHODS This was an observational study of 28 patients with MS and 17 patients with cerebral white matter lesions who did not have MS. Subjects were imaged using 7 T T2*-weighted imaging. White matter lesions were identified and analyzed for volume, location, and perivenous appearance. RESULTS Out of 901 lesions identified in patients with MS, 80{\%} were perivenous. In comparison, 19{\%} of 428 lesions identified in patients without MS had a perivenous appearance. Seven-Tesla T2*-weighted MRI reliably distinguished all patients with clinically definite MS ({\textgreater}40{\%} lesions appeared perivenous) from those without clinical MS ({\textless}40{\%} lesions appeared perivenous). Perivenous lesion appearance was more predictive of MS (odds ratio [OR] 14, p {\textless} 0.001) than subcortical or periventricular lesion location (OR 4.5, p {\textless} 0.001, and OR 2.4, p = 0.009). Perivenous lesion appearance was observed with a similar frequency in patients with clinically isolated syndrome of demyelination and in early (gadolinium-enhancing) MS lesions. CONCLUSION Perivenous lesion location on 7 T T2*-weighted imaging is predictive of the presence of demyelination. Optimization of this imaging technique at lower magnetic resonance field strengths would offer benefit for the diagnosis of MS.},

abstract = {Accurate classification and quantification of brain tissues is important for monitoring disease progression, measurement of atrophy, and correlating magnetic resonance (MR) measures with clinical disability. Classification of MR brain images in the presence of lesions, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), is particularly challenging. Images obtained with lower resolution often suffer from partial volume averaging leading to false classifications. While partial volume averaging can be reduced by acquiring volumetric images at high resolution, image segmentation and quantification can be technically challenging. In this study, we integrated the brain anatomical knowledge with non-parametric and parametric statistical classifiers for automatically classifying tissues and lesions on high resolution multichannel three-dimensional images acquired on 60 MS brains. The results of automatic lesion segmentation were reviewed by the expert. The agreement between results obtained by the automated analysis and the expert was excellent as assessed by the quantitative metrics, low absolute volume difference percent (36.18±34.90), low average symmetric surface distance (1.64mm±1.30mm), high true positive rate (84.75±12.69), and low false positive rate (34.10±16.00). The segmented results were also in close agreement with the corrected results as assessed by Bland–Altman and regression analyses. Finally, our lesion segmentation was validated using the MS lesion segmentation grand challenge dataset (MICCAI 2008).},

abstract = {The type, frequency, and extent of MR signal abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease and normal aging are a subject of controversy. With a 1.5-MR unit we studied 12 Alzheimer patients, four subjects suffering from multiinfarct dementia and nine age-matched controls. Punctate or early confluent high-signal abnormalities in the deep white matter, noted in 60{\%} of both Alzheimer patients and controls, were unrelated to the presence of hypertension or other vascular risk factors. A significant number of Alzheimer patients exhibited a more extensive smooth "halo" of periventricular hyperintensity when compared with controls (p = .024). Widespread deep white-matter hyperintensity (two patients) and extensive, irregular periventricular hyperintensity (three patients) were seen in multiinfarct dementia. Areas of high signal intensity affecting hippocampal and sylvian cortex were also present in five Alzheimer and two multiinfarct dementia patients, but absent in controls. Discrete, small foci of deep white-matter hyperintensity are not characteristic of Alzheimer's disease nor do they appear to imply a vascular cause for the dementing illness. The frequently observed "halo" of periventricular hyperintensity in Alzheimer's disease may be of diagnostic importance. High-signal abnormalities in specific cortical regions are likely to reflect disease processes localized to those structures.},

Model-based approaches use a priori information on cell shape features to obtain the segmentation, which may introduce a bias favouring the detection of cell nuclei only with certain properties. In this study we present a novel contour-based "minimum-model" cell detection and segmentation approach that uses minimal a priori information and detects contours independent of their shape. This approach avoids a segmentation bias with respect to shape features and allows for an accurate segmentation (precision = 0.908; recall = 0.859; validation based on ∼8000 manually-labeled cells) of a broad spectrum of normal and disease-related morphological features without the requirement of prior training.},

The biological tissue is generally distinguished from the inorganic matrix by the presence of a significant population of protons in the solid components that are well connected by dipolar spin couplings. Magnetic coupling between the solid and the liquid components generally dominates the magnetic field dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation rates observed in the small molecule components which is generally described by a power law in the Larmor frequency.

abstract = {Therapies that target the underlying pathology of multiple sclerosis (MS), including focal and diffuse damage, may improve long-term disease control. Focal damage (inflammatory lesions) manifests clinically mainly as relapses, whereas diffuse damage (neurodegeneration and brain volume loss) has been more closely associated with disability progression and cognitive decline. Given that first-line therapies such as beta-interferon and glatiramer acetate, which are primarily directed against inflammation, might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients, it has been recommended to switch these patients early to a therapy of higher efficacy, possibly targeting both components of MS pathology more rigorously. This review provides an overview of the efficacy of EU-approved disease-modifying therapies on conventional MS outcome measures (relapses, disability progression and paraclinical magnetic resonance imaging endpoints) in addition to brain volume loss, a measure of diffuse damage in the brain. In addition, the evidence supporting early treatment optimization in patients with high disease activity despite first-line therapy will be reviewed and an algorithm for optimal disease control will be presented.},

abstract = {The core concept within the field of brain mapping is the use of a standardized, or "stereotaxic", 3D coordinate frame for data analysis and reporting of findings from neuroimaging experiments. This simple construct allows brain researchers to combine data from many subjects such that group-averaged signals, be they structural or functional, can be detected above the background noise that would swamp subtle signals from any single subject. Where the signal is robust enough to be detected in individuals, it allows for the exploration of inter-individual variance in the location of that signal. From a larger perspective, it provides a powerful medium for comparison and/or combination of brain mapping findings from different imaging modalities and laboratories around the world. Finally, it provides a framework for the creation of large-scale neuroimaging databases or "atlases" that capture the population mean and variance in anatomical or physiological metrics as a function of age or disease.However, while the above benefits are not in question at first order, there are a number of conceptual and practical challenges that introduce second-order incompatibilities among experimental data. Stereotaxic mapping requires two basic components: (i) the specification of the 3D stereotaxic coordinate space, and (ii) a mapping function that transforms a 3D brain image from "native" space, i.e. the coordinate frame of the scanner at data acquisition, to that stereotaxic space. The first component is usually expressed by the choice of a representative 3D MR image that serves as target "template" or atlas. The native image is re-sampled from native to stereotaxic space under the mapping function that may have few or many degrees of freedom, depending upon the experimental design. The optimal choice of atlas template and mapping function depend upon considerations of age, gender, hemispheric asymmetry, anatomical correspondence, spatial normalization methodology and disease-specificity. Accounting, or not, for these various factors in defining stereotaxic space has created the specter of an ever-expanding set of atlases, customized for a particular experiment, that are mutually incompatible.These difficulties continue to plague the brain mapping field. This review article summarizes the evolution of stereotaxic space in term of the basic principles and associated conceptual challenges, the creation of population atlases and the future trends that can be expected in atlas evolution. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are areas of abnormal signal on magnetic resonance images (MRIs) that characterize various types of histopathological lesions. The load and location of WMHs are important clinical measures that may indicate the presence of small vessel disease in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Manually segmenting WMHs is time consuming and prone to inter-rater and intra-rater variabilities. Automated tools that can accurately and robustly detect these lesions can be used to measure the vascular burden in individuals with AD or the elderly population in general. Many WMH segmentation techniques use a classifier in combination with a set of intensity and location features to segment WMHs, however, the optimal choice of classifier is unknown. METHODS We compare 10 different linear and nonlinear classification techniques to identify WMHs from MRI data. Each classifier is trained and optimized based on a set of features obtained from co-registered MR images containing spatial location and intensity information. We further assess the performance of the classifiers using different combinations of MRI contrast information. The performances of the different classifiers were compared on three heterogeneous multi-site datasets, including images acquired with different scanners and different scan-parameters. These included data from the ADC study from University of California Davis, the NACC database and the ADNI study. The classifiers (na{\"{i}}ve Bayes, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, bagging, and boosting) were evaluated using a variety of voxel-wise and volumetric similarity measures such as Dice Kappa similarity index (SI), Intra-Class Correlation (ICC), and sensitivity as well as computational burden and processing times. These investigations enable meaningful comparisons between the performances of different classifiers to determine the most suitable classifiers for segmentation of WMHs. In the spirit of open-source science, we also make available a fully automated tool for segmentation of WMHs with pre-trained classifiers for all these techniques. RESULTS Random Forests yielded the best performance among all classifiers with mean Dice Kappa (SI) of 0.66±0.17 and ICC=0.99 for the ADC dataset (using T1w, T2w, PD, and FLAIR scans), SI=0.72±0.10, ICC=0.93 for the NACC dataset (using T1w and FLAIR scans), SI=0.66±0.23, ICC=0.94 for ADNI1 dataset (using T1w, T2w, and PD scans) and SI=0.72±0.19, ICC=0.96 for ADNI2/GO dataset (using T1w and FLAIR scans). Not using the T2w/PD information did not change the performance of the Random Forest classifier (SI=0.66±0.17, ICC=0.99). However, not using FLAIR information in the ADC dataset significantly decreased the Dice Kappa, but the volumetric correlation did not drastically change (SI=0.47±0.21, ICC=0.95). CONCLUSION Our investigations showed that with appropriate features, most off-the-shelf classifiers are able to accurately detect WMHs in presence of FLAIR scan information, while Random Forests had the best performance across all datasets. However, we observed that the performances of most linear classifiers and some nonlinear classifiers drastically decline in absence of FLAIR information, with Random Forest still retaining the best performance.},

Two versions are available, based on the full or on a restricted sample, each of these in three different resolutions (0.7 mm, 1.0 mm and 2.0 mm). The difference between the full sample and the restricted sample is that in the full sample, all subjects available at the time of the construction of the templates were used (N=853), whereas the restricted sample only subjects that presented none or the least volumes of white matter hyperintensities were used (see more details below). In addition to FLAIR, templates for gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and T1-weighted (T1) are also provided for both samples.},

abstract = {Many methods have been proposed for tissue segmentation in brain MRI scans. The multitude of methods proposed complicates the choice of one method above others. We have therefore established the MRBrainS online evaluation framework for evaluating (semi)automatic algorithms that segment gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on 3T brain MRI scans of elderly subjects (65-80 y). Participants apply their algorithms to the provided data, after which their results are evaluated and ranked. Full manual segmentations of GM, WM, and CSF are available for all scans and used as the reference standard. Five datasets are provided for training and fifteen for testing. The evaluated methods are ranked based on their overall performance to segment GM, WM, and CSF and evaluated using three evaluation metrics (Dice, H95, and AVD) and the results are published on the MRBrainS13 website. We present the results of eleven segmentation algorithms that participated in the MRBrainS13 challenge workshop at MICCAI, where the framework was launched, and three commonly used freeware packages: FreeSurfer, FSL, and SPM. The MRBrainS evaluation framework provides an objective and direct comparison of all evaluated algorithms and can aid in selecting the best performing method for the segmentation goal at hand.},

abstract = {There have been many efforts to automate segmentation of MS lesions in brain MRI, since human delineation is time consuming and error prone. However, most existing methods require multiple coregistered MR sequences, tissue priors or parametric models, and are rarely validated on multi-scanner image databases. In this work, a fast, FLAIR-only lesion segmentation algorithm is proposed, that does not use tissue priors or parametric models. The method uses an edge-based model of partial volume averaging to estimate fuzzy membership profiles of tissue classes. Results are further refined using an upstream image standardization pipeline, and downstream post processing. Lesion segmentation performance is measured on 15 volumes from three different scanners, demonstrating the robustness of the approach.},

abstract = {White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) of presumed vascular origin are common in ageing population, especially in patients with acute cerebral infarction and the volume has been reported to be associated with mental impairment and the risk of hemorrhage from antithrombotic agents. WMHs delineation can be computerized to minimize human bias. However, the presence of cerebral infarcts greatly degrades the accuracy of WMHs detection and thus limits the application of computerized delineation to patients with acute cerebral infarction. We propose a computer-assisted segmentation method to depict WMHs in the presence of cerebral infarcts in combined T1-weighted, fluid attenuation inversion recovery, and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The proposed method detects WMHs by empirical threshold and atlas information, with subtraction of white matter voxels affected by acute infarction. The method was derived using MRI from 25 hemispheres with WMHs only and 13 hemispheres with both WMHs and cerebral infarcts. Similarity index (SI) and correlation were utilized to assess the agreement between the new automated method and a gold standard visually guided semi-automated method done by an expert rater. The proposed WMHs segmentation approach produced average SI, sensitivity and specificity of 83.142±11.742, 84.154±16.086 and 99.988±0.029{\%} with WMHs only and of 68.826±14.036, 74.381±18.473 and 99.956±0.054{\%} with both WMHs and cerebral infarcts in the derivation cohort. The performance of the proposed method with an external validation cohort was also highly consistent with that of the experienced rater.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is inconsistent evidence that patients with stroke admitted to hospital out of regular working hours (such as weekends) experience worse outcomes. We aimed to identify if inequalities in the quality of care and mortality exist in contemporary stroke care in England.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: SINAP is a prospective database of acute stroke patients, documenting details of processes of care over the first 72 hours. We compared quality of care indicators and mortality at 72 hours, 7 days and 30 days, for patients who arrived within normal hours (Monday-Friday 8am to 6pm) and for those who arrived out of hours, using multivariable logistic and Cox proportional hazard models. Quality of care was defined according to time from arrival at hospital to interventions (e.g., brain scan), and whether the patient received therapeutic interventions (such as thrombolysis).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: 45,726 stroke patients were admitted to 130 hospitals in England between 1 April 2010 and 31 January 2012. Patients admitted out of hours (n = 23779) had more features indicative of worse prognosis (haemorrhagic stroke, reduced consciousness, pre stroke dependency). Out of hours admission was significantly associated with longer delays in receiving a CT scan or being admitted to a stroke unit, and reduced odds of receiving thrombolysis. After adjusting for casemix, there was no consistent evidence of higher mortality for patients admitted out of hours, but patients admitted at the weekends had a higher risk of 30 day mortality (OR 1.14, 95{\%} CI 1.06-1.21).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Inequalities in the provision of stroke care for people admitted out of regular hours persist in contemporary stroke in England. The association with mortality is small and largely attributable to higher illness severity in patients admitted out of hours.},

abstract = {The quantitative analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data has become increasingly important in both research and clinical studies aiming at human brain development, function, and pathology. Inevitably, the role of quantitative image analysis in the evaluation of drug therapy will increase, driven in part by requirements imposed by regulatory agencies. However, the prohibitive length of time involved and the significant intraand inter-rater variability of the measurements obtained from manual analysis of large MRI databases represent major obstacles to the wider application of quantitative MRI analysis. We have developed a fully automatic "pipeline" image analysis framework and have successfully applied it to a number of large-scale, multicenter studies (more than 1,000 MRI scans). This pipeline system is based on robust image processing algorithms, executed in a parallel, distributed fashion. This paper describes the application of this system to the automatic quantification of multiple sclerosis lesion load in MRI, in the context of a phase III clinical trial. The pipeline results were evaluated through an extensive validation study, revealing that the obtained lesion measurements are statistically indistinguishable from those obtained by trained human observers. Given that intra- and inter-rater measurement variability is eliminated by automatic analysis, this system enhances the ability to detect small treatment effects not readily detectable through conventional analysis techniques. While useful for clinical trial analysis in multiple sclerosis, this system holds widespread potential for applications in other neurological disorders, as well as for the study of neurobiology in general.},

abstract = {In this work, we present a new algorithm and benchmark dataset for stain separation in histology images. Histology is a critical and ubiq- uitous task in medical practice and research, serving as a gold stan- dard of diagnosis for many diseases. Automating routine histology analysis tasks could reduce health care costs and improve diagnostic accuracy. One challenge in automation is that histology slides vary in their stain intensity and color; we therefore seek a digital method to normalize the appearance of histology images. As histology slides often have multiple stains on them that must be normalized indepen- dently, stain separation must occur before normalization. We pro- pose a new digital stain separation method for the universally-used hematoxylin and eosin stain; this method improves on the state-of- the-art by adjusting the contrast of its eosin-only estimate and includ- ing a notion of stain interaction. To validate this method, we have collected a new benchmark dataset via chemical destaining contain- ing ground truth images for stain separation, which we release pub- licly. Our experiments show that our method achieves more accurate stain separation than two comparison methods and that this improve- ment in separation accuracy leads to improved normalization.},

Our team won both competitions in the grand challenge, obtaining an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.925 for the task of whole slide image classification and a score of 0.7051 for the tumor localization task. A pathologist independently reviewed the same images, obtaining a whole slide image classification AUC of 0.966 and a tumor localization score of 0.733. Combining our deep learning system's predictions with the human pathologist's diagnoses increased the pathologist's AUC to 0.995, representing an approximately 85 percent reduction in human error rate. These results demonstrate the power of using deep learning to produce significant improvements in the accuracy of pathological diagnoses.},

abstract = {We present a novel approach to automatically segment magnetic resonance (MR) images of the human brain into anatomical regions. Our methodology is based on a deep artificial neural network that assigns each voxel in an MR image of the brain to its corresponding anatomical region. The inputs of the network capture information at different scales around the voxel of interest: 3D and orthogonal 2D intensity patches capture a local spatial context while downscaled large 2D orthogonal patches and distances to the regional centroids enforce global spatial consistency. Contrary to commonly used segmentation methods, our technique does not require any non-linear registration of the MR images. To benchmark our model, we used the dataset provided for the MICCAI 2012 challenge on multi-atlas labelling, which consists of 35 manually segmented MR images of the brain. We obtained competitive results (mean dice coefficient 0.725, error rate 0.163) showing the potential of our approach. To our knowledge, our technique is the first to tackle the anatomical segmentation of the whole brain using deep neural networks.},

abstract = {One of the histological hallmarks of early multiple sclerosis lesions is primary demyelination, with myelin destruction and relative sparing of axons. On the other hand, it is widely accepted that axonal loss occurs in, and is responsible for, the permanent disability characterizing the later chronic progressive stage of the disease. In this study, we have used an antibody against amyloid precursor protein, known to be a sensitive marker of axonal damage in a number of other contexts, in immunocytochemical experiments on paraffin embedded multiple sclerosis lesions of varying ages in order to see at which stage of the disease axonal damage, in addition to demyelination, occurs and may thus contribute to the development of disability in patients. The results show the expression of amyloid precursor protein in damaged axons within acute multiple sclerosis lesions, and in the active borders of less acute lesions. This observation may have implications for the design and timing of therapeutic intervention, one of the most important aims of which must be the reduction of permanent disability.},

There was statistically significant correlation between nuclear perimeter and area with all the pathologic parameters, with the strongest association observed for nuclear grade (P {\textless}.0001).

DCIS lesions with necrosis and absence of polarization also revealed increased nuclear area and perimeter (P {\textless}.05). Comedo architecture was associated with larger nuclear area and perimeter (65.97 microm(2), 31.7 microm) than the papillary subtype (42.17 microm(2), 25.29 microm), with the mixed morphologic pattern disclosing intermediate values (54.83 microm(2), 29.43 microm). There was direct correlation for tumor size with nuclear area and perimeter (P {\textless}.01).

The algorithm is first evaluated with simulated images to assess the importance of the robust estimator in presence of outliers. The method is then validated using clinical data in which MS lesions were delineated manually by several experts. Our method obtains an average Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.65, which is close to the average DSC obtained by raters (0.66).},

abstract = {In multiple sclerosis (MS), a histopathological distinction is made between different stages of white matter (WM) lesions. These lesions are characterized as preactive, active, chronic active or chronic inactive, depending on the degree of microglia activation and degree of demyelination. The different lesions are not distinguishable on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at standard clinical field strengths, but might be distinguished using more advanced, quantitative MRI methods, such as T1 relaxation time (T1-RT) mapping. To investigate this, postmortem brain material from 20 MS patients was investigated, using both T1-RT MRI at 1.5 T and histopathology. The brain material contained a total of 9 preactive, 18 active, 30 chronic active and 14 chronic inactive lesions, as well as 38 areas of normal appearing WM (NAWM). Our results show that, at 1.5 T, T1-RT qMRI can only distinguish between categories NAWM/preactive, active and chronic WM lesions. Advanced imaging at standard field strengths, such as conventional imaging measures, is therefore insufficient to differentiate the WM lesions in MS, and higher field strengths may be required to achieve better pathological differentiation of these lesions.},

The performance of the CNN algorithm has been quantitatively evaluated by comparing the CNN output with the expert's manual delineation of MS lesions. The CNN algorithm was run on a data set of 11 MS patients; for each one a single dataset of MRI images (matrix resolution of 256x256 pixels) was acquired. Our automated approach gives satisfactory results showing that after the learning process the CNN is capable of detecting MS lesions with different shapes and intensities (mean DICE coefficient=0.64). The system could provide a useful support tool for the evaluation of lesions in MS patients, although it needs to be evolved and developed in the future.},

abstract = {Pelvic floor dysfunction is common in women after childbirth and precise segmentation of magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the pelvic floor may facilitate diagnosis and treatment of patients. However, because of the complexity of its structures, manual segmentation of the pelvic floor is challenging and suffers from high inter and intra-rater variability of expert raters. Multiple template fusion algorithms are promising segmentation techniques for these types of applications, but they have been limited by imperfections in the alignment of templates to the target, and by template segmentation errors. A number of algorithms sought to improve segmentation performance by combining image intensities and template labels as two independent sources of information, carrying out fusion through local intensity weighted voting schemes. This class of approach is a form of linear opinion pooling, and achieves unsatisfactory performance for this application. We hypothesized that better decision fusion could be achieved by assessing the contribution of each template in comparison to a reference standard segmentation of the target image and developed a novel segmentation algorithm to enable automatic segmentation of MRI of the female pelvic floor. The algorithm achieves high performance by estimating and compensating for both imperfect registration of the templates to the target image and template segmentation inaccuracies. A local image similarity measure is used to infer a local reliability weight, which contributes to the fusion through a novel logarithmic opinion pooling. We evaluated our new algorithm in comparison to nine state-of-the-art segmentation methods and demonstrated our algorithm achieves the highest performance.},

abstract = {We make an analogy between images and statistical mechanics systems. Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.},

Here a new approach to the correction of intra-slice intensity variations is presented. Results demonstrate that the correction process enhances the performance of backpropagation neural network classifiers designed for the segmentation of the images. Two slightly different versions of the method are presented. The first version fits an intensity correction surface directly to reference points selected by the user in the images. The second version fits the surface to reference points obtained by an intermediate classification operation. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of both methods reveals that the first one leads to a better correction of the images than the second but that it is more sensitive to operator errors.},

Features seen on neuroimaging include recent small subcortical infarcts, lacunes, white matter hyperintensities, perivascular spaces, microbleeds, and brain atrophy. SVD can present as a stroke or cognitive decline, or can have few or no symptoms. SVD frequently coexists with neurodegenerative disease, and can exacerbate cognitive deficits, physical disabilities, and other symptoms of neurodegeneration. Terminology and definitions for imaging the features of SVD vary widely, which is also true for protocols for image acquisition and image analysis. This lack of consistency hampers progress in identifying the contribution of SVD to the pathophysiology and clinical features of common neurodegenerative diseases. We are an international working group from the Centres of Excellence in Neurodegeneration. We completed a structured process to develop definitions and imaging standards for markers and consequences of SVD. We aimed to achieve the following: first, to provide a common advisory about terms and definitions for features visible on MRI; second, to suggest minimum standards for image acquisition and analysis; third, to agree on standards for scientific reporting of changes related to SVD on neuroimaging; and fourth, to review emerging imaging methods for detection and quantification of preclinical manifestations of SVD. Our findings and recommendations apply to research studies, and can be used in the clinical setting to standardise image interpretation, acquisition, and reporting.

abstract = {The clinical application of chemotherapy to brain malignancies has been severely limited because many potential therapeutic agents are typically unable to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB). A novel approach to overcome this barrier uses focused ultrasound to induce localized BBB disruption in a targeted region of the brain and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to guide and monitor the procedure. The purpose of this thesis was to develop a technique using MRI-guided focused ultrasound for trans bbb drug delivery applications. This thesis demonstrates that MRI-guided focused ultrasound can be used to achieve consistent and reproducible BBB disruption without invasive craniotomy in rats, to enable doxorubicin to accumulate in normal brain at clinically therapeutic levels, and to increase the antitumoral efficacy of doxorubicin in a rodent model of aggressive glioma. Using a microbubble-based ultrasonographic contrast agent, focal BBB opening was consistently achieved using transcranial focal pressures of 1.2 MPa or greater; locations in the posterior brain exhibited consistent BBB disruption with applied focal pressures of 0.8 MPa or greater. When combined with systemic administration of liposomal doxorubicin, we achieved local drug concentrations of 900 ± 300 ng/g tissue in the brain with minimal tissue effects, and up to 5400 ± 700 ng/g tissue with more significant tissue damage, while accumulation in non-targeted contralateral brain tissue remained significantly lower (p {\textless} 0.001). In addition, MRI signal enhancement in the sonicated region correlated strongly with doxorubicin concentration in tissue (r = 0.87), suggesting that contrast-enhanced MRI may provide useful feedback on drug penetration.(cont.) Finally, glioma-bearing rats treated with ultrasound-enhanced chemotherapy exhibited significantly longer median survival times (31 versus 25 days; p = 0.0007) and slower tumor growth (average tumor volume doubling time, 3.7 ± 0.5 days, versus 2.3 ± 0.3 days) than nontreated rats; rats which received standard intravenous chemotherapy showed no significant difference in survival or tumor growth rate. In sum, this thesis research provides pre-clinical data toward the development of MRI-guided focused ultrasound as a noninvasive method for the delivery of agents such as doxorubicin across the BBB to treat patients with diseases of the central nervous system.},

Automatic and reliable quantitative analysis tools, including segmentation, allow to analyze brain development and to understand specific patterns of many neurological diseases. This field has recently experienced many advances with successful techniques based on non-linear warping and label fusion. In this work we present a novel and fully automatic pipeline for volumetric brain analysis based on multi-atlas label fusion technology that is able to provide accurate volumetric information at different levels of detail in a short time. This method is available through the volBrain online web interface (http://volbrain.upv.es), which is publically and freely accessible to the scientific community. Our new framework has been compared with current state-of-the-art methods showing very competitive results.},

The workgroup sought to ensure that the revised criteria would be flexible enough to be used by both general healthcare providers without access to neuropsychological testing, advanced imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid measures, and specialized investigators involved in research or in clinical trial studies who would have these tools available. We present criteria for all-cause dementia and for AD dementia. We retained the general framework of probable AD dementia from the 1984 criteria. On the basis of the past 27 years of experience, we made several changes in the clinical criteria for the diagnosis. We also retained the term possible AD dementia, but redefined it in a manner more focused than before. Biomarker evidence was also integrated into the diagnostic formulations for probable and possible AD dementia for use in research settings. The core clinical criteria for AD dementia will continue to be the cornerstone of the diagnosis in clinical practice, but biomarker evidence is expected to enhance the pathophysiological specificity of the diagnosis of AD dementia. Much work lies ahead for validating the biomarker diagnosis of AD dementia. ?? 2011 The Alzheimer's Association. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Intensity normalization is an important pre-processing step in the study and analysis of Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) of human brains. As most parametric supervised automatic image segmentation and classification methods base their assumptions regarding the intensity distributions on a standardized intensity range, intensity normalization takes on a very significant role. One of the fast and accurate approaches proposed for intensity normalization is that of Nyul and colleagues. In this work, we present, for the first time, an extensive validation of this approach in real clinical domain where even after intensity inhomogeneity correction that accounts for scanner-specific artifacts, the MRI volumes can be affected from variations such as data heterogeneity resulting from multi-site multi-scanner acquisitions, the presence of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions and the stage of disease progression in the brain. Using the distributional divergence criteria, we evaluate the effectiveness of the normalization in rendering, under the distributional assumptions of segmentation approaches, intensities that are more homogenous for the same tissue type while simultaneously resulting in better tissue type separation. We also demonstrate the advantage of the decile based piece-wise linear approach on the task of MS lesion segmentation against a linear normalization approach over three image segmentation algorithms: a standard Bayesian classifier, an outlier detection based approach and a Bayesian classifier with Markov Random Field (MRF) based post-processing. Finally, to demonstrate the independence of the effectiveness of normalization from the complexity of segmentation algorithm, we evaluate the Nyul method against the linear normalization on Bayesian algorithms of increasing complexity including a standard Bayesian classifier with Maximum Likelihood parameter estimation and a Bayesian classifier with integrated data priors, in addition to the above Bayesian classifier with MRF based post-processing to smooth the posteriors. In all relevant cases, the observed results are verified for statistical relevance using significance tests. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The lack of a standard image intensity scale in MRI causes many difficulties in image display and analysis. A two-step postprocessing method is proposed for standardizing the intensity scale in such a way that for the same MR protocol and body region, similar intensities will have similar tissue meaning. In the first step, the parameters of the standardizing transformation are "learned" from a set of images. In the second step, for each MR study these parameters are used to map their histogram into the standardized histogram. The method was tested quantitatively on 90 whole-brain studies of multiple sclerosis patients for several protocols and qualitatively for several other protocols and body regions. Measurements using mean squared difference showed that the standardized image intensities have statistically significantly (P {\textless} 0.01) more consistent range and meaning than the originals. Fixed gray level windows can be established for the standardized images and used for display without the need of per case adjustment. Preliminary results also indicate that the method facilitates improving the degree of automation of image segmentation. Magn Reson Med 42:1072-1081, 1999.},

abstract = {Histometric features for the objective grading of prostatic adenocarcinoma in histologic specimens were analyzed in five cases each of well, moderately and poorly differentiated lesions. Tissue sections from the selected cases were stained by the Feulgen method and digitized by a video-based microphotometer. Twenty total fields were recorded for each grade: ten at high resolution (an image sampling of 0.5 micron per pixel) and ten at low resolution (0.8 micron per pixel), with two fields per case recorded at each resolution. The images were segmented by an automated expert system-guided scene segmentation procedure. The performance of that procedure was measured by comparing the automated counts of nuclei in the segmented fields to the visual counts made by a pathologist in the same fields. For well, moderately and poorly differentiated cases, respectively, the nuclear counts made by the expert system at high resolution were 2.7{\%}, 4.2{\%} and 4.7{\%} higher than the visual counts (as estimated from a total of 6,628 nuclei), but 1.2{\%}, 2.5{\%} and 1.1{\%} lower at low resolution (10,329 nuclei). High-resolution features and tissue textural features were computed for each case. The high-resolution features showed good separation between the three groups of cases. The tissue textural features showed consistent separation between well and moderately differentiated cases. The relaxation of the spatial resolution (to 0.8 micron/pixel spacing) did not affect the selection of features, but led to less separation between the data from different grades. In conclusion, the automated system performed satisfactorily in distinguishing sections of prostatic tumors of varying degrees of differentiation.},

abstract = {It has been reported that the severity of subcortical vascular dementia (VaD) correlated with an area ratio of white matter hyperintensity (WMH) regions to the brain parenchyma (WMH area ratio). The purpose of this study was to develop a computer-aided evaluation method of WMH regions for diagnosis of subcortical VaD based on magnetic resonance (MR) images. A brain parenchymal region was segmented based on the histogram analysis of a T1-weigthed image. The WMH regions were segmented on the subtraction image between a T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) images using two segmentation methods, i.e., a region-growing technique and a level-set method, which were automatically and adaptively selected on each WMH region based on its image features by using a support vector machine. We applied the proposed method to 33 slices of the three types of MR images with 245 lesions, which were acquired from 10 patients (age range: 64-90 years, mean: 78) with a diagnosis of VaD on a 1.5-T MR imaging scanner. The average similarity index between regions determined by a manual method and the proposed method was 93.5 ?? 2.0{\%} for brain parenchymal regions and 78.2 ?? 11.0{\%} for WMH regions. The WMH area ratio obtained by the proposed method correlated with that determined by two neuroradiologists with a correlation coefficient of 0.992. The results presented in this study suggest that the proposed method could assist neuroradiologists in the evaluation of WMH regions related to the subcortical VaD. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The technique is based on the central volume principle (CBF = CBV/MTT) and requires the use of commercially available software employing complex deconvolution algorithms to produce the perfusion maps. Some controversies exist regarding this technique, including which artery to use as input vessel, the accuracy of quantitative results, and the reproducibility of results. Despite these controversies, perfusion CT has been found to be useful for noninvasive diagnosis of cerebral ischemia and infarction and for evaluation of vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Perfusion CT has also been used for assessment of cerebrovascular reserve by using acetazolamide challenge in patients with intracranial vascular stenoses who are potential candidates for bypass surgery or neuroendovascular treatment, for the evaluation of patients undergoing temporary balloon occlusion to assess collateral flow and cerebrovascular reserve, and for the assessment of microvascular permeability in patients with intracranial neoplasms.

In order to shed some light on this topic, we perform, through a novel framework, an exhaustive analysis of the adequateness of the most commonly used performance scores to assess this complex scenario. We conclude that using unweighted Holder means with exponent p≤1 to average the recalls of all the classes produces adequate scores which are capable of determining whether a classifier is competitive. Then, we review the major solutions presented in the class-imbalance literature. Since any learning task can be defined as an optimisation problem where a loss function, usually connected to a particular score, is minimised, our goal, here, is to find whether the learning tasks found in the literature are also oriented to maximise the previously detected adequate scores. We conclude that they usually maximise the unweighted Holder mean with p=1 (a-mean). Finally, we provide bounds on the values of the studied performance scores which guarantee a classifier with a higher recall than the random classifier in each and every class.},

abstract = {This paper addresses segmentation of multiple sclerosis lesions in multispectral 3-D brain MRI data. For this purpose, we propose a novel fully automated segmentation framework based on probabilistic boosting trees, which is a recently introduced strategy for supervised learning. By using the context of a voxel to be classified and its transformation to an overcomplete set of Haar-like features, it is possible to capture class specific characteristics despite the well-known drawbacks of MR imaging. By successively selecting and combining the most discriminative features during ensemble boosting within a tree structure, the overall procedure is able to learn a discriminative model for voxel classification in terms of posterior probabilities. The final segmentation is obtained after refining the preliminary result by stochastic relaxation and a standard level set approach. A quantitative evaluation within a leave-one-out validation shows the applicability of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Small vessel disease (SVD) is an important cause of stroke, cognitive decline, and age-related disability. The cause of SVD is unknown, increasing evidence from neuropathology and neuroimaging suggests that failure of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) precipitates or worsens cerebral SVD progression and its failure is associated with SVD features such as white matter hyperintensities (WMH), perivascular spaces (PVS) and lacunar infarcts. The BBB change mechanism may also contribute to other common disorders of ageing such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revolutionised our understanding of SVD features. The MRI contributes to better understanding of the SVD pathophysiology and their clinical correlates. The purpose of this project was to better understand the pathogenesis of SVD, which involves improved understanding of BBB structures and pathophysiology and accurate measurement of cerebral SVD imaging characteristics on MRI scans. We aimed to assess (1) structures related to the BBB and factors that affect the BBB; (2) efficient and consistent WMH measurement method; (3) effect of stroke lesions on WMH and cerebral atrophy progression; (4) development and optimisation of computational PVS measurement method; (5) the relationships between PVS and SVD, blood markers, and BBB permeability. Section one describes structures and pathophysiology of the BBB. I reviewed the BBB structural and functional components from the view of neurovascular unit, PVS, and junctional proteins. The PVS part was done in a systematic search. I also reviewed some common stimuli for BBB permeability including inflammation and ischemia. Ischemic triggers for the BBB permeability were summarized systematically. Based on the literatures above, I summarized changes in junctional proteins in ischemia, inflammatory pain and AD models. Section two describes accurate measurement of WMH progression and atrophy. I used data from 100 patients who participated in a stroke study about BBB permeability changes in lacunar versus cortical stroke. To find a most efficient and consistent WMH measurement method, we tested several computational methods and effect of common processing steps including bias field correction and intensity adjustment. To avoid the effect of artefacts, I did a systematic search about artefacts and tested methods of image segmentation to avoid WMH artefacts as much as possible. To investigate the effect of stroke lesions on WMH and atrophy progression, I did the WMH, atrophy segmentation and stroke lesion measurements in a subgroup of 46 patients with follow-up scans, and showed that stroke lesions distorted measurement of WMH and atrophy progression and should be excluded. Section three describes development and optimization of a computational PVS measurement method, which measures the count and volume for PVS based on a threshold method using AnalyzeTM software. We tested the observer variability and validated it by comparison with visual rating scores. We investigated the associations between PVS results with other SVD features (WMH, atrophy), risk factors (hypertension, smoking and diabetes), blood markers, and BBB permeability. In conclusion, MRI is a valuable tool for the investigation of cerebral SVD features and BBB permeability. Exclusions of artefacts and stroke lesions are important in accurate measurement of WMH. PVS are important features of BBB abnormalities, and they correlate and share risk factors with other SVD features, and they should be considered as a marker of SVD and BBB permeability. Further systematic histological and ultrastructural studies of BBB are desirable in understanding the BBB regarding to the different parts of the cerebral vascular tree.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is unknown whether white matter lesions (WML) develop abruptly in previously normal brain areas, or whether tissue changes are already present before WML become apparent on MRI. We therefore investigated whether development of WML is preceded by quantifiable changes in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). METHODS: In 689 participants from the general population (mean age 67 years), we performed 2 MRI scans (including diffusion tensor imaging and Fluid Attenuation Inversion Recovery [FLAIR] sequences) 3.5 years apart using the same 1.5-T scanner. Using automated tissue segmentation, we identified NAWM at baseline. We assessed which NAWM regions converted into WML during follow-up and differentiated new WML into regions of WML growth and de novo WML. Fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and FLAIR intensity of regions converting to WML and regions of persistent NAWM were compared using 3 approaches: a whole-brain analysis, a regionally matched approach, and a voxel-wise approach. RESULTS: All 3 approaches showed that low fractional anisotropy, high mean diffusivity, and relatively high FLAIR intensity at baseline were associated with WML development during follow-up. Compared with persistent NAWM regions, NAWM regions converting to WML had significantly lower fractional anisotropy (0.337 vs 0.387; P{\textless}0.001), higher mean diffusivity (0.910 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s vs 0.729 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s; P{\textless}0.001), and relatively higher normalized FLAIR intensity (1.233 vs -0.340; P{\textless}0.001). This applied to both NAWM developing into growing and de novo WML. CONCLUSIONS: White matter changes in NAWM are present and can be quantified on diffusion tensor imaging and FLAIR before WML develop. This suggests that WML develop gradually, and that visually appreciable WML are only the tip of the iceberg of white matter pathology.},

abstract = {The variations in the intensity scale in Magnetic Resonance Images pose a problem for many tasks and Intensity Standardization (IS) aims to solve this problem. Existing methods generally use landmark values of the image histogram and match it to a standard scale. The landmarks are often chosen to be percentiles from different segmented tissues. We propose a method for IS in which tissue information (via segmentation) is needed during training but not during testing by using landmark propagation. A KL divergence-based technique is employed for identifying volumes from the training set, which are similar to a given non-standardized testing volume. The landmarks from the similar volumes are then propagated to the given test volume. Evaluation of the proposed method on 24 MRI volumes from 3 different scanners shows that the IS results are better than L4 and at par with a method which uses prior segmentation, to get percentile-based landmarks. The proposed method aids speeding up and expanding the scope of IS to volumes with no tissue information.},

abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) have shown excellent results on many visual classification tasks. With the exception of ImageNet, these datasets are carefully crafted such that objects are well-aligned at similar scales. Naturally, the feature learning problem gets more challenging as the amount of variation in the data increases, as the models have to learn to be invariant to certain changes in appearance. Recent results on the ImageNet dataset show that given enough data, ConvNets can learn such invariances producing very discriminative features [1]. But could we do more: use less parameters, less data, learn more discriminative features, if certain invariances were built into the learning process? In this paper we present a simple model that allows ConvNets to learn features in a locally scale-invariant manner without increasing the number of model parameters. We show on a modified MNIST dataset that when faced with scale variation, building in scale-invariance allows ConvNets to learn more discriminative features with reduced chances of over-fitting.},

Manually segmenting WMHs in large cohorts is technically unfeasible due to time and accuracy concerns. Automated tools that can detect WMHs robustly and with high accuracy are needed. Here we present and validate a fully automatic technique for segmentation and volumetric quantification of WMHs in aging and AD. The proposed technique combines intensity and location features from multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrasts and manually labeled training data with a linear classifier to perform fast and robust segmentations. It provides both a continuous subject specific WMH map reflecting different levels of tissue damage and binary segmentations. The method was used to detect WMHs in 80 elderly/AD brains (ADC dataset) as well as 40 healthy subjects at risk of AD (PREVENT-AD dataset). Robustness across different scanners was validated using 10 subjects from ADNI2/GO study. Voxel-wise and volumetric agreements were evaluated using Dice similarity index (SI) and intra-class correlation (ICC), yielding ICC=0.96, SI=0.62±0.16 for ADC dataset and ICC=0.78, SI=0.51±0.15 for PREVENT-AD dataset. The proposed method was robust in the independent sample yielding SI=0.64±0.17 with ICC=0.93 for ADNI2/GO subjects. The proposed method provides fast, accurate and robust segmentations on previously unseen data from different models of scanners, making it ideal to study WMHs in large scale multi-site studies},

abstract = {This paper presents a sparse representation and an adaptive dictionary learning based method for automated classification of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions in magnetic resonance (MR) images. Manual delineation of MS lesions is a time-consuming task, requiring neuroradiology experts to analyze huge volume of MR data. This, in addition to the high intra- and inter-observer variability necessitates the requirement of automated MS lesion classification methods. Among many image representation models and classification methods that can be used for such purpose, we investigate the use of sparse modeling. In the recent years, sparse representation has evolved as a tool in modeling data using a few basis elements of an over-complete dictionary and has found applications in many image processing tasks including classification. We propose a supervised classification approach by learning dictionaries specific to the lesions and individual healthy brain tissues, which include white matter (WM), gray matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The size of the dictionaries learned for each class plays a major role in data representation but it is an even more crucial element in the case of competitive classification. Our approach adapts the size of the dictionary for each class, depending on the complexity of the underlying data. The algorithm is validated using 52 multi-sequence MR images acquired from 13 MS patients. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in MS lesion classification.},

The first two extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domains of PirB and LilrB2 mediate this interaction, leading to enhanced cofilin signaling, also seen in human AD brains. In mice, the deleterious effect of Ab oligomers on hippocampal long-term potentiation required PirB, and in a transgenic model of AD, PirB not only contributed to memory deficits present in adult mice, but also mediated loss of synaptic plasticity in juvenile visual cortex.

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The segmentation and volumetric quantification of white matter (WM) lesions play an important role in monitoring and studying neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or cerebrovascular disease. This is often interactively done using 2D magnetic resonance images. Recent developments in acquisition techniques allow for 3D imaging with much thinner sections, but the large number of images per subject makes manual lesion outlining infeasible. This warrants the need for a reliable automated approach. Here we aimed to improve k nearest neighbor (kNN) classification of WM lesions by optimizing intensity normalization and using spatial tissue type priors (TTPs).

METHODS: The kNN-TTP method used kNN classification with 3.0 T 3DFLAIR and 3DT1 intensities as well as MNI-normalized spatial coordinates as features. Additionally, TTPs were computed by nonlinear registration of data from healthy controls. Intensity features were normalized using variance scaling, robust range normalization or histogram matching. The algorithm was then trained and evaluated using a leave-one-out experiment among 20 patients with MS against a reference segmentation that was created completely manually. The performance of each normalization method was evaluated both with and without TTPs in the feature set. Volumetric agreement was evaluated using intra-class coefficient (ICC), and voxelwise spatial agreement was evaluated using Dice similarity index (SI). Finally, the robustness of the method across different scanners and patient populations was evaluated using an independent sample of elderly subjects with hypertension.

RESULTS: The intensity normalization method had a large influence on the segmentation performance, with average SI values ranging from 0.66 to 0.72 when no TTPs were used. Independent of the normalization method, the inclusion of TTPs as features increased performance particularly by reducing the lesion detection error. Best performance was achieved using variance scaled intensity features and including TTPs in the feature set: this yielded ICC = 0.93 and average SI = 0.75 ± 0.08. Validation of the method in an independent sample of elderly subjects with hypertension, yielded even higher ICC = 0.96 and SI = 0.84 ± 0.14.

CONCLUSION: Adding TTPs increases the performance of kNN based MS lesion segmentation methods. Best performance was achieved using variance scaling for intensity normalization and including TTPs in the feature set, showing excellent agreement with the reference segmentations across a wide range of lesion severity, irrespective of the scanner used or the pathological substrate of the lesions.},

abstract = {—Measures of overlap of labelled regions of images, such as the Dice and Tanimoto coefficients, have been extensively used to evaluate image registration and segmentation algorithms. Modern studies can include multiple labels defined on multiple images yet most evaluation schemes report one overlap per labelled region, simply averaged over multiple images. In this paper, common overlap measures are generalized to measure the total overlap of ensembles of labels defined on multiple test images and account for fractional labels using fuzzy set theory. This framework allows a single “figure-of-merit” to be reported which summarises the results of a complex experiment by image pair, by label or overall. A complementary measure of error, the overlap distance, is defined which captures the spatial extent of the nonoverlapping part and is related to the Hausdorff distance computed on grey level images. The generalized overlap measures are validated on synthetic images for which the overlap can be computed analytically and used as similarity measures in nonrigid registration of three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain images. Finally, a pragmatic segmentation ground truth is constructed by registering a magnetic resonance atlas brain to 20 individual scans, and used with the overlap measures to evaluate publicly available brain segmentation algorithms.},

The shared 4-kDa subunit indicates a common origin for the amyloids of the plaque core and of the congophilic angiopathy. There are superficial resemblances between the solubility characteristics of the plaque core and some of the properties of scrapie infectivity, but there are no similarities in amino acid sequences between the plaque core and scrapie polypeptides.},

abstract = {Fast fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (fFLAIR) is more sensitive that conventional or fast spin echo T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for detecting lesions in the brain of patients with ischemic, inflammatory, or demyelinating diseases of the CNS. We investigated whether the use of fFLAIR also increases the sensitivity of brain MRI assessment in patients with systemic autoimmune disorders. Turbo spin echo (TSE) dual-echo and fFLAIR scans of the brain were obtained from patients affected by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with (NSLE, n = 9) and without clinical CNS involvement (n = 15), Beh{\c{c}}et disease (n = 5), Wegener granulomatosis (n = 9), and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (n = 6). Brain hyperintense lesions were counted and classified according to their size and their location by two observers by consensual agreement. The total lesion volume was measured using a semiautomated technique for lesion segmentation on both TSE and fFLAIR scans. The imaging modalities showed brain hyperintense lesions in all 9 SLE patients with CNS involvement, 5 of 15 SLE patients without CNS involvement, 5 of 9 patients with Wegener granulomatosis, 1 of 5 with Beh{\c{c}}et disease, and 3 of 6 with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. A total of 342 lesions were seen on both sequences; 88 were seen only on TSE and 54 only on fFLAIR scans. The average number of brain lesions per scan was higher on TSE than on fFLAIR, since significantly more discrete (P{\textless}0.002) and small (P = 0.004) lesions were seen on TSE than on fFLAIR. The median total lesion volume, however, was similar on TSE and fFLAIR. Our study indicates that the use of fFLAIR does not improve the sensitivity of fast dual-echo MRI for detecting brain abnormalities in patients with systemic autoimmune disorders.},

abstract = {This work presents a descriptive study of noise distributions in images reconstructed according to the parallel imaging methods SENSE and GRAPPA. In the computer simulations, two different settings were used for describing an object. The first setting included a synthetic object and eight complex-valued coil sensitivities. In the second setting, a complex-valued in vitro object, composed of four individual coil images, was used. After adding noise and subsampling k-space for each coil image, reconstruction was performed according to SENSE, with and without regularization, and GRAPPA for different reduction factors. A set of images was created for three different reduction factors. Noise distributions were determined for each data set and compared with each other. The results of this study show that the noise distributions in SENSE- and GRAPPA-reconstructed images differ. The noise in images reconstructed according to GRAPPA has a more uniform spatial distribution compared with SENSE-reconstructed images, in which the noise varies regionally according to the geometry factor. The noise distribution in SENSE-reconstructed images using regularization showed a similar but lowered pattern of noise compared with images reconstructed according to SENSE without regularization.},

abstract = {This work concerns the development of a novel contrast enhancement algorithm for FLAIR-weighted cerebral MRI with white matter lesions (WML). The proposed method utilizes both a robust estimate of edge magnitude and intensity values to discriminate between pathological and non-pathological information. These two features are combined through several transformations, such that WML are highlighted, and normal appearing white/gray matter are suppressed. The technique utilizes information solely computed from each image and thus adapts to the input image's characteristics. The results show a significant improvement of the contrast between white matter lesions and other brain tissue (average contrast improvement of 41.1{\%}). To demonstrate the robustness of such an enhancement scheme for WML analysis, a threshold-based segmenter is applied, which extracts the WML with good results.},

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources PubMed from 1966 to 23 November 2009. Study selection Prospective longitudinal studies that used magnetic resonance imaging and assessed the impact of white matter hyperintensities on risk of incident stroke, cognitive decline, dementia, and death, and, for the meta-analysis, studies that provided risk estimates for a categorical measure of white matter hyperintensities, assessing the impact of these lesions on risk of stroke, dementia, and death. Data extraction Population studied, duration of follow-up, method used to measure white matter hyperintensities, definition of the outcome, and measure of the association of white matter hyperintensities with the outcome. Data synthesis 46 longitudinal studies evaluated the association of white matter hyperintensities with risk of stroke (n=12), cognitive decline (n=19), dementia (n=17), and death (n=10). 22 studies could be included in a meta-analysis (nine of stroke, nine of dementia, eight of death). White matter hyperintensities were associated with an increased risk of stroke (hazard ratio 3.3, 95{\%} confidence interval 2.6 to 4.4), dementia (1.9, 1.3 to 2.8), and death (2.0, 1.6 to 2.7). An association of white matter hyperintensities with a faster decline in global cognitive performance, executive function, and processing speed was also suggested. Conclusion White matter hyperintensities predict an increased risk of stroke, dementia, and death. Therefore white matter hyperintensities indicate an increased risk of cerebrovascular events when identified as part of diagnostic investigations, and support their use as an intermediate marker in a research setting. Their discovery should prompt detailed screening for risk factors of stroke and dementia.},

abstract = {The projections of the anterior and posterior commissures (AC/PC) on the mid-sagittal plane of the human brain are important landmarks in neuroimaging. They can be used, for example, during MRI scanning for acquiring the imaging sections in a standard orientation. In post-acquisition image processing, these landmarks serve to establish an anatomically-based frame of reference within the brain that can be extremely useful in designing automated image analysis algorithms such as image segmentation and registration methods. This paper presents a fully automatic model-based algorithm for AC/PC detection on MRI scans. The algorithm utilizes information from a number of model images on which the locations of the AC/PC and a reference point (the vertex of the superior pontine sulcus) are known. This information is then used to locate the landmarks on test scans by template matching. The algorithm is designed to be fast, robust, and accurate. The method is flexible in that it can be trained to work on different image contrasts, optimized for different populations, or scanning modes. To assess the effectiveness of this technique, we compared automatically and manually detected landmark locations on 84 T1-weighted and 42 T2-weighted test scans. Overall, the average Euclidean distance between automatically and manually detected landmarks was 1.1??mm.

abstract = {In studies of patients with focal brain lesions, it is often useful to coregister an image of the patient's brain to that of another subject or a standard template. We refer to this process as spatial normalization. Spatial normalization can improve the presentation and analysis of lesion location in neuropsychological studies; it can also allow other data, for example from functional imaging, to be compared to data from other patients or normal controls. In functional imaging, the standard procedure for spatial normalization is to use an automated algorithm, which minimizes a measure of difference between image and template, based on image intensity values. These algorithms usually optimize both linear (translations, rotations, zooms, and shears) and nonlinear transforms. In the presence of a focal lesion, automated algorithms attempt to reduce image mismatch between template and image at the site of the lesion. This can lead to significant inappropriate image distortion, especially when nonlinear transforms are used. One solution is to use cost-function masking-masking the areas used in the calculation of image difference-to exclude the area of the lesion, so that the lesion does not bias the transformations. We introduce and evaluate this technique using normalizations of a selection of brains with focal lesions and normal brains with simulated lesions. Our results suggest that cost-function masking is superior to the standard approach to this problem, which is affine-only normalization; we propose that cost-function masking should be used routinely for normalizations of brains with focal lesions.},

This paper presents a method designed to detect hyperintense signal area on T2-FLAIR sequence and its results on the Challenge test data. The proposed algorithm uses only three conventional MRI sequences: T1, T2 and T2-FLAIR. First, images are cropped, spatially unbiased and skull-stripped. A segmentation of the brain into its different compartments is performed on the T1 and the T2 sequences. From these segmentations, a threshold for the T2-FLAIR sequence is automatically computed. Then postprocessing operations select the most plausible lesions in the obtained hyperintense signals. Average global result on the test data (80/100) is close to the inter-expert variability (90/100).},

abstract = {Quantitative analysis has tremendous but mostly unrealized potential in healthcare to support objective and accurate interpretation of the clinical imaging. In 2008, the National Cancer Institute began building the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) initiative with the goal of advancing quantitative imaging in the context of personalized therapy and evaluation of treatment response. Computerized analysis is an important component contributing to reproducibility and efficiency of the quantitative imaging techniques. The success of quantitative imaging is contingent on robust analysis methods and software tools to bring these methods from bench to bedside.3D Slicer is a free open-source software application for medical image computing. As a clinical research tool, 3D Slicer is similar to a radiology workstation that supports versatile visualizations but also provides advanced functionality such as automated segmentation and registration for a variety of application domains. Unlike a typical radiology workstation, 3D Slicer is free and is not tied to specific hardware. As a programming platform, 3D Slicer facilitates translation and evaluation of the new quantitative methods by allowing the biomedical researcher to focus on the implementation of the algorithm and providing abstractions for the common tasks of data communication, visualization and user interface development. Compared to other tools that provide aspects of this functionality, 3D Slicer is fully open source and can be readily extended and redistributed. In addition, 3D Slicer is designed to facilitate the development of new functionality in the form of 3D Slicer extensions. In this paper, we present an overview of 3D Slicer as a platform for prototyping, development and evaluation of image analysis tools for clinical research applications. To illustrate the utility of the platform in the scope of QIN, we discuss several use cases of 3D Slicer by the existing QIN teams, and we elaborate on the future directions that can further facilitate development and validation of imaging biomarkers using 3D Slicer. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Niessen1999,
abstract = {Segmentation of MR brain images using intensity values is severely limited owing to field inhomogeneities, susceptibility artifacts and partial volume effects. Edge based segmentation methods suffer from spurious edges and gaps in boundaries. A multiscale method to MRI brain segmentation is presented which uses both edge and intensity information. First a multiscale representation of an image is created, which can be made edge dependent to favor intra-tissue diffusion over inter-tissue diffusion. Subsequently a multiscale linking model (the hyperstack) is used to group voxels into a number of objects based on intensity. It is shown that both an improvement in accuracy and a reduction in image post-processing can be achieved if edge dependent diffusion is used instead of linear diffusion. The combination of edge dependent diffusion and intensity based linking facilitates segmentation of grey matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid with minimal user interaction. To segment the total brain (white matter plus grey matter) morphological operations are applied to remove small bridges between the brain and cranium. If the total brain is segmented, grey matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid can be segmented by joining a small number of segments. Using a supervised segmentation technique and MRI simulations of a brain phantom for validation it is shown that the errors are in the order of or smaller than reported in literature.},

abstract = {In this thesis, we present three image processing tools inspired by and designed for histology image analysis. Histology, which is the examination of biological tissue under a microscope, is a critical technique in biomedical research and clinical practice. While slide preparation and imaging is increasingly becoming automated, the analysis of the resulting histology images is not: even routine analyses still require the trained eyes of a pathologist. In our work, we aim to understand histology images as a class of signals and develop tools to aid in the automated analysis of these signals. Our first contribution is in the area of histology image normalization, where the goal is to digitally remove the variation in staining between histology images, an important preprocessing step in many histology image analysis systems. To this end, we created a new benchmark dataset with which to compare normalization methods and proposed our own. Our second contribution is a tissue segmentation method, which delineates sigle-tissue regions in histology images. Along with this method, we propose a new mathematical model for histology images. Our final contribution is a method for describing distributions of angles, which is useful for segmentation as well as a variety of other image processing tasks.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging is a popular and powerful non-invasive imaging technique. Automated analysis has become mandatory to efficiently cope with the large amount of data generated using this modality. However, several artifacts, such as intensity non-uniformity, can degrade the quality of acquired data. Intensity non-uniformity consists in anatomically irrelevant intensity variation throughout data. It can be induced by the choice of the radio-frequency coil, the acquisition pulse sequence and by the nature and geometry of the sample itself. Numerous methods have been proposed to correct this artifact. In this paper, we propose an overview of existing methods. We first sort them according to their location in the acquisition/processing pipeline. Sorting is then refined based on the assumptions those methods rely on. Next, we present the validation protocols used to evaluate these different correction schemes both from a qualitative and a quantitative point of view. Finally, availability and usability of the presented methods is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The proposed method is a two-stage approach that first filters the noisy image using a non local PCA thresholding strategy by automatically estimating the local noise level present in the image and second uses this filtered image as a guide image within a rotationally invariant non-local means filter. The proposed method internally estimates the amount of local noise presents in the images that enables applying it automatically to images with spatially varying noise levels and also corrects the Rician noise induced bias locally.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CSF pulsation artifact is a pitfall of fast fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) brain MR imaging. We studied ventricular CSF pulsation artifact (VCSFA) on axial FLAIR images and its relationship to age and ventricular size. METHODS: Fast FLAIR axial images were obtained on a 1.5-T unit (8000/150/2 [TR/TE/ excitations], inversion time = 2200, field of view = 24 cm, matrix = 189x256, and 5-mm interleaved sections). Two observers rated VCSFA (hyperintensity on FLAIR images) in the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles by using a three-point ordinal scale in 100 consecutive subjects (ages 20-86 years) with normal brain MR studies. Left-to-right third ventricular width was also measured. RESULTS: Seventy-two subjects had VCSFA in at least one ventricular cavity. The fourth ventricle was the most common site of VCSFA (n = 58), followed by the third ventricle (n = 47) and the lateral ventricles (n = 13). VCSFA was usually severe in the third and fourth ventricles and less severe in the lateral ventricles. Fourth ventricular VCSFA was significantly associated with third ventricular VCSFA. Increasing third ventricular size and, to a lesser extent, increasing age was significantly associated with VCSFA. Ghost pulsation of VCSFA occurred across the brain parenchyma in the phase-encoding direction. VCSFA seen in the fourth ventricle on axial FLAIR images disappeared on sagittal FLAIR images in one subject. CONCLUSION: VCSFA on axial FLAIR images represents inflow artifact caused by inversion delay and ghosting effects. VCSFA might obscure or mimic intraventricular lesions, especially in the third and fourth ventricles. Although common in adults of all ages, VCSFA is associated with advancing age and increasing ventricular size. Thus, altered CSF flow dynamics that occur with ventriculomegaly and aging contribute to VCSFA on axial FLAIR MR images.},

abstract = {This paper describes a new model-based segmentation technique combining desirable properties of physical models (snakes), shape representation by Fourier parametrization, and modelling of natural shape variability. Flexible parametric shape models are represented by a parameter vector describing the mean contour and by a set of eigenmodes of the parameters characterizing the shape variation. Usually the segmentation process is divided into an initial placement of the mean model and an elastic deformation restricted to the model variability. This, however, leads to a separation of biological variation due to a global similarity transform from small-scale shape changes originating from elastic deformations of the normalized model contours only. The performance can be considerably improved by building shape models normalized with respect to a small set of stable landmarks (AC-PC in our application) and by explaining the remaining variability among a series of images with the model flexibility. This way the image interpretation is solved by a new coarse-to-fine segmentation procedure based on the set of deformation eigenmodes, making a separate initialization step unnecessary. Although straightforward, the extension to 3-D is severely impeded by difficulties arising during the generation of a proper surface parametrization for arbitrary objects with spherical topology. We apply a newly developed surface parametrization which achieves a uniform mapping between object surface and parameter space. The 3-D procedure is demonstrated by segmenting deep structures of the human brain from MR volume data.},

@article{Ashburner1997,
abstract = {This paper presents a method for the coregistration and partitioning (i.e., tissue segmentation) of brain images that have been acquired in different modalities. The basic idea is that instead of matching two images directly, one performs intermediate within-modality registrations to two template images that are already in register. One can use a least-squares minimization to determine the affine transformations that map between the templates and the images. By incorporating suitable constraints, a rigid body transformation which directly maps between the images can be extracted from these more general affine transformations. A further refinement capitalizes on the implicit normalization of both images into a standard space. This facilitates segmentation or partitioning of both original images into homologous tissue classifications. Once partitioned, the partitions can be jointly matched, further increasing the accuracy of the coregistration. In short, these techniques reduce the between- modality problem to a series of simpler within-modality problems. These methods are relatively robust, address a number of problems in image transformations, and require no manual intervention. (C) 1997 Academic Press},

In this paper, we review and compare the large number of automated approaches proposed for segmentation of WMH in the elderly and in patients with vascular risk factors. We conclude that, in order to avoid artifacts and exclude the several sources of bias that may influence the analysis, an optimal method should comprise a careful preprocessing of the images, be based on multimodal, complementary data, take into account spatial information about the lesions and correct for false positives. All these features should not exclude computational leanness and adaptability to available data.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are frequently observed on MRI in ischemic stroke patients as well as in normal elderly individuals. Besides the progression of WMH, the regression of WMH has been rarely reported. Thus, we aimed to investigate how WMH change over time in patients with ischemic stroke, particularly focusing on regression. METHODS: We enrolled ischemic stroke patients who underwent brain MRI more than twice with at least a 6 month time-interval. Based on T2-weighted or FLAIR MRI, WMH were visually assessed, followed by semiautomatic volume measurement. Progression or regression of WMH change was defined when 0.25 cc increase or decrease was observed and it was also combined with visible change. A statistical analysis was performed on the pattern of WMH change over time and factors associated with change. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients were enrolled. Their age (mean±SD) was 67.5±11.8 years and 63 were male. The imaging time-interval (mean) was 28.0 months. WMH progressed in 27, regressed in 9 and progressed in distinctive regions and regressed in others in 5 patients. A multiple logistic regression model showed that age (odds ratio[OR] 2.51, 90{\%} confidence interval[CI] 1.056-5.958), male gender (OR 2.957, 95{\%} CI 1.051-9.037), large vessel disease (OR 1.955, 95{\%} CI 1.171-3.366), and renal dysfunction (OR 2.900, 90{\%} CI 1.045-8.046) were associated with progression. Regarding regression, no significant factor was found in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In 21.5{\%} of ischemic stroke patients, regression of WMH was observed. WMH progression was observed in a third of ischemic stroke patients.},

In this paper, we present a statistical framework for PV segmentation that encompasses and extends existing techniques. We start from a commonly used parametric statistical image model in which each voxel belongs to one single tissue type, and introduce an additional downsampling step that causes partial voluming along the borders between tissues. An expectation-maximization approach is used to simultaneously estimate the parameters of the resulting model and perform a PV classification. We present results on well-chosen simulated images and on real MR images of the brain, and demonstrate that the use of appropriate spatial prior knowledge not only improves the classifications, but is often indispensable for robust parameter estimation as well. We conclude that general robust PV segmentation of MR brain images requires statistical models that describe the spatial distribution of brain tissues more accurately than currently available models.},

abstract = {Focal demyelinated plaques in white matter, which are the hallmark of multiple sclerosis pathology, only partially explain the patient's clinical deficits. We thus analysed global brain pathology in multiple sclerosis, focusing on the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and the cortex. Autopsy tissue from 52 multiple sclerosis patients (acute, relapsing-remitting, primary and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis) and from 30 controls was analysed using quantitative morphological techniques. New and active focal inflammatory demyelinating lesions in the white matter were mainly present in patients with acute and relapsing multiple sclerosis, while diffuse injury of the NAWM and cortical demyelination were characteristic hallmarks of primary and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Cortical demyelination and injury of the NAWM, reflected by diffuse axonal injury with profound microglia activation, occurred on the background of a global inflammatory response in the whole brain and meninges. There was only a marginal correlation between focal lesion load in the white matter and diffuse white matter injury, or cortical pathology, respectively. Our data suggest that multiple sclerosis starts as a focal inflammatory disease of the CNS, which gives rise to circumscribed demyelinated plaques in the white matter. With chronicity, diffuse inflammation accumulates throughout the whole brain, and is associated with slowly progressive axonal injury in the NAWM and cortical demyelination.},

abstract = {We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via adversarial nets, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitatively evaluation of the generated samples.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the extent of white matter high intensity lesions (WML) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an independent predictor of risk for stroke from arteriolosclerosis, and whether serial evaluation of WML can be used to identify patients who are at risk of strokes. METHODS: Prospective follow up with serial MRI scans was done in 89 patients who were either diagnosed as having symptomatic lacunar infarcts or were stroke-free, neurologically normal individuals with headache or dizziness. None had significant stenosis of major cerebral arteries or atrial fibrillation. Multivariable analysis with the Cox proportional hazards model was used to test the predictive value for subsequent stroke of risk factor status at entry and during follow up, lacunar infarction, and the extent of WML (scored from 0 to 16) on the baseline scans. RESULTS: During follow up (mean (SD), 51 (19) months), seven strokes occurred (five lacunar infarcts and two haemorrhages): four in nine patients with severe WML (score 9-16), and three in 40 patients with mild WML (score 1-8) (log-rank test; p {\textless} 0.005). None of 40 patients without WML experienced stroke. The extent of WML was an independent predictor of subsequent stroke (relative risk for a 1 point score increase, 1.60; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.02 to 2.54; p {\textless} 0.05). In three strokes among 80 patients without severe WML, two occurred in four patients with an increase in WML score during follow up, and one occurred in the other 76 patients without an increased score (p {\textless} 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Severe WML at baseline is an independent predictor of risk for stroke from arteriolosclerosis, while progression of WML during follow up may be associated with subsequent stroke in patients with initially mild WML.},

abstract = {Reliable quantification of white matter hyperintensities of presumed vascular origin (WMHs) is increasingly needed, given the presence of these MRI findings in patients with several neurological and vascular disorders, as well as in elderly healthy subjects. We present BIANCA (Brain Intensity AbNormality Classification Algorithm), a fully automated, supervised method for WMH detection, based on the k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) algorithm. Relative to previous k-NN based segmentation methods, BIANCA offers different options for weighting the spatial information, local spatial intensity averaging, and different options for the choice of the number and location of the training points. BIANCA is multimodal and highly flexible so that the user can adapt the tool to their protocol and specific needs. We optimised and validated BIANCA on two datasets with different MRI protocols and patient populations (a “predominantly neurodegenerative” and a “predominantly vascular” cohort). BIANCA was first optimised on a subset of images for each dataset in terms of overlap and volumetric agreement with a manually segmented WMH mask. The correlation between the volumes extracted with BIANCA (using the optimised set of options), the volumes extracted from the manual masks and visual ratings showed that BIANCA is a valid alternative to manual segmentation. The optimised set of options was then applied to the whole cohorts and the resulting WMH volume estimates showed good correlations with visual ratings and with age. Finally, we performed a reproducibility test, to evaluate the robustness of BIANCA, and compared BIANCA performance against existing methods. Our findings suggest that BIANCA, which will be freely available as part of the FSL package, is a reliable method for automated WMH segmentation in large cross-sectional cohort studies.},

abstract = {Histopathology gives the definitive diagnosis for many diseases, including breast cancer. Recent criticisms of manual histopathology image analysis have motivated quality assurance programs examining this modality. This chapter reviews the challenges associated with conventional histopathology workflows, with specific focus on inconsistencies in manual analysis. These challenges are then contrasted with the advantages of digital workflows, including better database management, ease of remote consultations, and the potential for automated analysis. The remainder of the chapter explores the design of an automated analysis algorithm for classifying breast cancer histological image samples as either benign or malignant. Three complex image features are designed with inspiration from the Nottingham Grading System used by pathologists for the same task. Such features discriminate the two classes well using simple classifiers (SVM and Bayes) under 3-fold cross validation and in a challenging database of 58 images with artifacts and stain variability. These results illustrate the feasibility of hand-designed features, in light of recent deep learning approaches, particularly in problem spaces where training examples are few.},

@article{Nyul2000,
abstract = {One of the major drawbacks of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been the lack of a standard and quantifiable interpretation of image intensities. Unlike in other modalities, such as X-ray computerized tomography, MR images taken for the same patient on the same scanner at different times may appear different from each other due to a variety of scanner-dependent variations and, therefore, the absolute intensity values do not have a fixed meaning. We have devised a two-step method wherein all images (independent of patients and the specific brand of the MR scanner used) can be transformed in such a way that for the same protocol and body region, in the transformed images similar intensities will have similar tissue meaning. Standardized images can be displayed with fixed windows without the need of per-case adjustment. More importantly, extraction of quantitative information about healthy organs or about abnormalities can be considerably simplified. This paper introduces and compares new variants of this standardizing method that can help to overcome some of the problems with the original method.},

abstract = {Magnetic Resonance (MR) white matter hyperintensities have been shown to predict an increased risk of developing cognitive decline. However, their actual role in the conversion to dementia is still not fully understood. Automatic segmentation methods can help in the screening and monitoring of Mild Cognitive Impairment patients who take part in large population-based studies. Most existing segmentation approaches use multimodal MR images. However, multiple acquisitions represent a limitation in terms of both patient comfort and computational complexity of the algorithms. In this work, we propose an automatic lesion segmentation method that uses only three-dimensional fluid-attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. We use a modified context-sensitive Gaussian mixture model to determine voxel class probabilities, followed by correction of FLAIR artifacts. We evaluate the method against the manual segmentation performed by an experienced neuroradiologist and compare the results with other unimodal segmentation approaches. Finally, we apply our method to the segmentation of multiple sclerosis lesions by using a publicly available benchmark dataset. Results show a similar performance to other state-of-the-art multimodal methods, as well as to the human rater. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Motivated by the vast amount of information that is rapidly accumulating about the human brain in digital form, we embarked upon a program in 1992 to develop a four-dimensional probabilistic atlas and reference system for the human brain. Through an International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM) a dataset is being collected that includes 7000 subjects between the ages of eighteen and ninety years and including 342 mono- and dizygotic twins. Data on each subject includes detailed demographic, clinical, behavioural and imaging information. DNA has been collected for genotyping from 5800 subjects. A component of the programme uses post-mortem tissue to determine the probabilistic distribution of microscopic cyto- and chemoarchitectural regions in the human brain. This, combined with macroscopic information about structure and function derived from subjects in vivo, provides the first large scale opportunity to gain meaningful insights into the concordance or discordance in micro- and macroscopic structure and function. The philosophy, strategy, algorithm development, data acquisition techniques and validation methods are described in this report along with database structures. Examples of results are described for the normal adult human brain as well as examples in patients with Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. The ability to quantify the variance of the human brain as a function of age in a large population of subjects for whom data is also available about their genetic composition and behaviour will allow for the first assessment of cerebral genotype-phenotype-behavioural correlations in humans to take place in a population this large. This approach and its application should provide new insights and opportunities for investigators interested in basic neuroscience, clinical diagnostics and the evaluation of neuropsychiatric disorders in patients.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Postacquisition combination of three-dimensional T2-weighted (T2w) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images can improve the visualization of brain lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, an optimal way to combine these images has not been described so far. The main objective of this study is to investigate an optimal combination of T2w and FLAIR to improve the conspicuity of MS lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We determined the parameters for a generalized multiplicative image combination which maximize the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) between lesions and normal-appearing brain tissue through simulations and verified experimentally. MRI data from 11 MS patients acquired at 3 Tesla were retrospectively analyzed using the proposed approach and compared with conventional FLAIR, and to images obtained by direct multiplication of T2w and FLAIR (FLAIR2 ). Image quality was assessed by region-of-interest analysis. In addition, to evaluate the degree of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) suppression, CSF-to-gray matter (CSF/GM) ratio was calculated. Reduction in global image contrast was assessed by computing the reduction in the contrast of mid-level intensity values. RESULTS: An optimal combination was found to be the third order expression: FLAIR3 = FLAIR1.55 x T2w1.45 . Compared with FLAIR, the lesion CNR was significantly increased by 1.9x (P {\textless} 0.005) and 2.5x (P {\textless} 0.001) using FLAIR2 and FLAIR3 , respectively. CSF/GM ratio was increased by 1.7x in FLAIR2 (P {\textless} 0.001) compared with FLAIR, while it was reduced to 0.7x on FLAIR3 (P {\textless} 0.05). The mid-intensity contrast was preserved on FLAIR2 (P = 0.2), and decreased by 29{\%} on FLAIR3 (P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSION: These results show that the optimized combination of FLAIR and T2w can improve MS lesion conspicuity. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2016;44:1293-1300.},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently.

We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The association between cerebral white matter lesions (WMLs) and the risk of falls in older people is uncertain, with no supporting prospective evidence. We aimed to determine the risk of incident falls associated with WML volume, and the interactions between WML volume, gait, and other sensorimotor factors leading to falls. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, population-based study (n=294, mean age 72.3 years, independently mobile). Volumetric MRI, computerized gait measures, and sensorimotor measures of falls risk were obtained at baseline. Incident falls were recorded prospectively over a 12-month period. Using regression modeling, we estimated the risk of incident falls associated with baseline WML volume. RESULTS: Increasing baseline WML volume was independently associated with any incident fall (P=0.01) and multiple incident falls (P=0.02). The risk of incident falls was doubled in people with lesion volumes in the highest quintile of its distribution compared with the lowest (adjusted relative risk, 2.32; 95{\%} CI, 1.28-4.14). Greater lesion volume was also associated with poorer gait and greater gait variability (both P{\textless}0.001). The effect of WML volume on the risk of falls was magnified in people with poorer quadriceps muscle strength (P=0.03) and greater gait variability (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These data provide the first prospective evidence to our knowledge demonstrating that WMLs are strong risk factors for falls in the general older population. WMLs present potential therapeutic targets for interventional trials in falls prevention.},

Realization of this potential depends on the ability to rapidly and precisely quantify the protein expression within each tissue spot. We have developed a set of algorithms that allow the rapid, automated, continuous and quantitative analysis of tissue microarrays, including the separation of tumor from stromal elements and the sub-cellular localization of signals. Validation studies using estrogen receptor in breast carcinoma show that automated analysis matches or exceeds the results of conventional pathologist-based scoring. Automated analysis and sub-cellular localization of beta-catenin in colon cancer identifies two novel, prognostically significant tumor subsets, not detected by traditional pathologist-based scoring. Development of automated analysis technology empowers tissue microarrays for use in discovery-type experiments (more typical of cDNA microarrays), with the added advantage of inclusion of long-term demographic and patient outcome information.},

abstract = {Among brain tumors, gliomas are the most common and aggressive, leading to a very short life expectancy in their highest grade. Thus, treatment planning is a key stage to improve the quality of life of oncological patients. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a widely used imaging technique to assess these tumors, but the large amount of data produced by MRI prevents manual segmentation in a reasonable time, limiting the use of precise quantitative measurements in the clinical practice. So, automatic and reliable segmentation methods are required; however, the large spatial and structural variability among brain tumors make automatic segmentation a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an automatic segmentation method based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), exploring small 33 kernels. The use of small kernels allows designing a deeper architecture, besides having a positive effect against overfitting, given the fewer number of weights in the network. We also investigated the use of intensity normalization as a pre-processing step, which though not common in CNN-based segmentation methods, proved together with data augmentation to be very effective for brain tumor segmentation in MRI images. Our proposal was validated in the Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge 2013 database (BRATS 2013), obtaining simultaneously the first position for the complete, core, and enhancing regions in Dice Similarity Coefficient metric (0:88, 0:83, 0:77) for the Challenge data set. Also, it obtained the overall first position by the online evaluation platform. We also participated in the on-site BRATS 2015 Challenge using the same model, obtaining the second place, with Dice Similarity Coefficient metric of 0:78, 0:65, and 0:75 for the complete, core, and enhancing regions, respectively.},

Careful and well-conducted large population studies are needed in order to truly understand the natural history of the disease, its imaging biomarkers, and their links to patient outcomes. The Canadian Atherosclerosis Imaging Network (CAIN) is a unique research network funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Canada Foundation for Innovation and designed to address these needs and to enable large population-based imaging studies. The central objective of CAIN is to move innovations in imaging toward their broad application in clinical research and clinical practice for the improved evaluation of cardiac and neurologic vascular disease. CAIN is established as an international resource for studying the natural history, progression, and regression of atherosclerosis, as well as novel therapeutic interventions aimed at atherosclerosis. The network represents Canada's leading atherosclerosis imaging experts, embodying both basic imaging science and clinical imaging research. The network is improving methods of detection and treatment of atherosclerosis and, through a better understanding of the underlying disease itself, improving strategies for disease prevention. The benefits are expected to appear in the next 2 to 3 years. CAIN will drive innovation in imaging technology within the field of cardiology and neurology and improve health outcomes in Canada and worldwide. ?? 2013 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.},

We describe an optimized method of VBM to examine the effects of age on grey and white matter and CSF in 465 normal adults. Global grey matter volume decreased linearly with age, with a significantly steeper decline in males. Local areas of accelerated loss were observed bilaterally in the insula, superior parietal gyri, central sulci, and cingulate sulci. Areas exhibiting little or no age effect (relative preservation) were noted in the amygdala, hippocampi, and entorhinal cortex. Global white matter did not decline with age, but local areas of relative accelerated loss and preservation were seen. There was no interaction of age with sex for regionally specific effects. These results corroborate previous reports and indicate that VBM is a useful technique for studying structural brain correlates of ageing through life in humans.},

abstract = {White matter lesions (WML) are the main brain imaging surrogate of cerebral small-vessel disease. A new MRI tissue segmentation method, based on a discriminative clustering approach without explicit model-based added prior, detects partial WML volumes, likely representing very early-stage changes in normal-appearing brain tissue. This study investigated how the different stages of WML, from a "pre-visible" stage to fully developed lesions, predict future cognitive decline. MRI scans of 78 subjects, aged 65-84 years, from the Leukoaraiosis and Disability (LADIS) study were analyzed using a self-supervised multispectral segmentation algorithm to identify tissue types and partial WML volumes. Each lesion voxel was classified as having a small (33{\%}), intermediate (66{\%}), or high (100{\%}) proportion of lesion tissue. The subjects were evaluated with detailed clinical and neuropsychological assessments at baseline and at three annual follow-up visits. We found that voxels with small partial WML predicted lower executive function compound scores at baseline, and steeper decline of executive scores in follow-up, independently of the demographics and the conventionally estimated hyperintensity volume on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. The intermediate and fully developed lesions were related to impairments in multiple cognitive domains including executive functions, processing speed, memory, and global cognitive function. In conclusion, early-stage partial WML, still too faint to be clearly detectable on conventional MRI, already predict executive dysfunction and progressive cognitive decline regardless of the conventionally evaluated WML load. These findings advance early recognition of small vessel disease and incipient vascular cognitive impairment.},

abstract = {We introduce a generative probabilistic model for segmentation of brain lesions in multi-dimensional images that generalizes the EM segmenter, a common approach for modelling brain images using Gaussian mixtures and a probabilistic tissue atlas that employs expectation-maximization (EM), to estimate the label map for a new image. Our model augments the probabilistic atlas of the healthy tissues with a latent atlas of the lesion. We derive an estimation algorithm with closed-form EM update equations. The method extracts a latent atlas prior distribution and the lesion posterior distributions jointly from the image data. It delineates lesion areas individually in each channel, allowing for differences in lesion appearance across modalities, an important feature of many brain tumor imaging sequences. We also propose discriminative model extensions to map the output of the generative model to arbitrary labels with semantic and biological meaning, such as “tumor core” or “fluid-filled structure”, but without a one-to-one correspondence to the hypo- or hyper-intense lesion areas identified by the generative model. We test the approach in two image sets: the publicly available BRATS set of glioma patient scans, and multimodal brain images of patients with acute and subacute ischemic stroke. We find the generative model that has been designed for tumor lesions to generalize well to stroke images, and the extended discriminative -discriminative model to be one of the top ranking methods in the BRATS evaluation.},

abstract = {We evaluated the effect of interscanner variation on brain MRI-measured lesion volumes and measurement reproducibility in MS. Twenty clinically definite MS patients were each scanned on two or three scanners (a total of 14 scanners were used). In addition, a formalin-fixed MS brain was studied on eight scanners from different manufacturers and with different field strengths. For the formalin-fixed MS brain, on each machine we obtained two scans with slice thicknesses of 5 and 3 mm. Only 5-mm-thick slices were obtained from patients. The lesion volume present on each scan was evaluated three times by a single observer in random order, using a local thresholding technique. In two groups of eight patients scanned on machines with different field strengths, the mean lesion volumes present on scans obtained at 1.5 T were significantly higher than those measured on scans obtained with machines operating at 0.5 and 1.0 T (p {\textless} 0.01). When a single observer repeatedly evaluated the same scan, a median intraobserver agreement of 98.7{\%}(95{\%} CI, 97.9 to 99.1) was achieved. However, when the observer evaluated the scans from different MRI scanners, the agreement (an interscanner agreement) fell to 91.1{\%} (CI, 90.2 to 94.1). When only scanners operating at 1.5 T were considered, the median interscanner agreement was 96.7{\%} (CI, 95 to 97.5). Also, for the formalin-fixed MS brain, the intraobserver agreements obtained with both slice thicknesses were significantly higher than the corresponding interscanner agreements. The interscanner agreement, but not the intraobserver agreement, obtained with a slice thickness of 3 mm was higher than that obtained with a slice thickness of 5 mm. Our results indicate that lesion volume measurements in MS are influenced significantly by the use of different MR scanners and that a patient included in a serial study should be always scanned with the same MR machine using 3-mm thick slices.},

abstract = {The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is an ongoing, longitudinal, multicenter study designed to develop clinical, imaging, genetic, and biochemical biomarkers for the early detection and tracking of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study aimed to enroll 400 subjects with early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 200 subjects with early AD, and 200 normal control subjects; {\$}67 million funding was provided by both the public and private sectors, including the National Institute on Aging, 13 pharmaceutical companies, and 2 foundations that provided support through the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health. This article reviews all papers published since the inception of the initiative and summarizes the results as of February 2011. The major accomplishments of ADNI have been as follows: (1) the development of standardized methods for clinical tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in a multicenter setting; (2) elucidation of the patterns and rates of change of imaging and CSF biomarker measurements in control subjects, MCI patients, and AD patients. CSF biomarkers are consistent with disease trajectories predicted by \beta-amyloid cascade (Hardy, J Alzheimers Dis 2006;9(Suppl 3):151-3) and tau-mediated neurodegeneration hypotheses for AD, whereas brain atrophy and hypometabolism levels show predicted patterns but exhibit differing rates of change depending on region and disease severity; (3) the assessment of alternative methods of diagnostic categorization. Currently, the best classifiers combine optimum features from multiple modalities, including MRI, [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, CSF biomarkers, and clinical tests; (4) the development of methods for the early detection of AD. CSF biomarkers, \beta-amyloid 42 and tau, as well as amyloid PET may reflect the earliest steps in AD pathology in mildly symptomatic or even nonsymptomatic subjects, and are leading candidates for the detection of AD in its preclinical stages; (5) the improvement of clinical trial efficiency through the identification of subjects most likely to undergo imminent future clinical decline and the use of more sensitive outcome measures to reduce sample sizes. Baseline cognitive and/or MRI measures generally predicted future decline better than other modalities, whereas MRI measures of change were shown to be the most efficient outcome measures; (6) the confirmation of the AD risk loci CLU, CR1, and PICALM and the identification of novel candidate risk loci; (7) worldwide impact through the establishment of ADNI-like programs in Europe, Asia, and Australia; (8) understanding the biology and pathobiology of normal aging, MCI, and AD through integration of ADNI biomarker data with clinical data from ADNI to stimulate research that will resolve controversies about competing hypotheses on the etiopathogenesis of AD, thereby advancing efforts to find disease-modifying drugs for AD; and (9) the establishment of infrastructure to allow sharing of all raw and processed data without embargo to interested scientific investigators throughout the world. The ADNI study was extended by a 2-year Grand Opportunities grant in 2009 and a renewal of ADNI (ADNI-2) in October 2010 through to 2016, with enrollment of an additional 550 participants. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Alzheimer¢s Association.

Currently, white matter lesions are divided into periventricular white matter lesions and deep white matter lesions. Although the meaning of these terms varies by study and this dichotomization itself is still in debate, a possible dissimilarity in pathogenic mechanisms between periventricular white matter lesions and deep white matter lesions are providing some clues for understanding pathophysiology of many geriatric syndromes associated with white matter lesions. We have reviewed the distinctions between periventricular white matter lesions and deep white matter lesions in terms of etiology, histopathology, functional correlates, and imaging methodologies. We suggest a new subclassification of white matter lesions that might have better etiological and functional relevance than the current simple dichotomization. The new categories are juxtaventricular, periventricular, deep white, and juxtacortical. This new classification scheme might contribute to reducing the heterogeneity of white matter lesion findings in future research. ?? 2008 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) on a 2-minute electrocardiogram are a common, largely asymptomatic finding associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease and death. They may reflect atherosclerosis or other pathogenic pathways that predispose to arrhythmias and stroke. METHODS: We conducted a prospective evaluation of the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities Study cohort (n=14,783) of middle-aged men and women to assess whether the presence of PVCs at study baseline (1987 to 1989) influenced the risk of incident stroke through December 31, 2004. RESULTS: PVCs were seen in 6.1{\%} of the participants at baseline, and 729 (4.9{\%}) had incident stroke. The unadjusted cumulative proportion of incident stroke in individuals with any PVC was 6.6{\%} compared with 4.1{\%} in those without PVC. The unadjusted hazard ratio of incident stroke in individuals with any PVC compared with those without any PVCs was 1.71 (95{\%} CI, 1.33 to 2.20). Among individuals without hypertension and diabetes at baseline, PVCs were independently associated with incident stroke (hazard ratio: 1.72; 95{\%} CI: 1.14 to 2.59). Among those with either diabetes or hypertension, the presence of any PVCs did not increase the risk of stroke. The association was stronger for noncarotid embolic stroke than for thrombotic stroke and its magnitude increased with higher frequency of PVCs. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent PVCs are associated with risk of incident stroke in participants free of hypertension and diabetes. This suggests that PVCs may contribute to atrioventricular remodeling or may be a risk marker for incident stroke, particularly embolic stroke.},

abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been recently employed to solve problems from both the computer vision and medical image analysis fields. Despite their popularity, most approaches are only able to process 2D images while most medical data used in clinical practice consists of 3D volumes. In this work we propose an approach to 3D image segmentation based on a volumetric, fully convolutional, neural network. Our CNN is trained end-to-end on MRI volumes depicting prostate, and learns to predict segmentation for the whole volume at once. We introduce a novel objective function, that we optimise during training, based on Dice coefficient. In this way we can deal with situations where there is a strong imbalance between the number of foreground and background voxels. To cope with the limited number of annotated volumes available for training, we augment the data applying random non-linear transformations and histogram matching. We show in our experimental evaluation that our approach achieves good performances on challenging test data while requiring only a fraction of the processing time needed by other previous methods.},

abstract = {The NINCDS-ADRDA and the DSM-IV-TR criteria for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the prevailing diagnostic standards in research; however, they have now fallen behind the unprecedented growth of scientific knowledge. Distinctive and reliable biomarkers of AD are now available through structural MRI, molecular neuroimaging with PET, and cerebrospinal fluid analyses. This progress provides the impetus for our proposal of revised diagnostic criteria for AD. Our framework was developed to capture both the earliest stages, before full-blown dementia, as well as the full spectrum of the illness. These new criteria are centred on a clinical core of early and significant episodic memory impairment. They stipulate that there must also be at least one or more abnormal biomarkers among structural neuroimaging with MRI, molecular neuroimaging with PET, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis of amyloid $\beta$ or tau proteins. The timeliness of these criteria is highlighted by the many drugs in development that are directed at changing pathogenesis, particularly at the production and clearance of amyloid $\beta$ as well as at the hyperphosphorylation state of tau. Validation studies in existing and prospective cohorts are needed to advance these criteria and optimise their sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most powerful tool for the early (differential) diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and has been part of the International Panel criteria (2001, 2005, 2010) for more than 10 years. The role of brain and spinal cord MRI in the diagnosis of MS is well established. New MR techniques and markers will further improve the diagnostic value in a research and clinical routine setting. In addition to diagnosis, MRI is widely used for prognostic evaluation as well as treatment efficacy and safety monitoring. This field has gained importance with the introduction of new MS therapeutics. Therefore, the scope of MRI-guided MS disease monitoring has been widened to include rigorous treatment monitoring aiming at "no evidence of disease activity (NEDA)". Next, safety monitoring of treated MS patients has become major concern to enable early detection of opportunistic infections such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Driven by these new developments, recently published expert panel guidelines stressed the need for standardized imaging protocols and targeted specialized imaging markers for MS diagnosis and disease monitoring. This review article aims to give an update on the role of MRI in the diagnosis and monitoring of MS with particular emphasis to treatment efficacy and safety, both in clinical practice and in research.},

abstract = {Rapid advances are occurring in the field of cytopathology, particularly in the field of digital imaging. Today, digital images are used in a variety of settings including education (E-education), as a substitute to multiheaded sessions, multisite conferences, publications, cytopathology web pages, cytology proficiency testing, telecytology, consultation through telecytology, and automated screening of Pap test slides. The accessibility provided by digital imaging in cytopathology can improve the quality and efficiency of cytopathology services, primarily by getting the expert cytopathologist to remotely look at the slide. This improved accessibility saves time and alleviates the need to ship slides, wait for glass slides, or transport pathologists. Whole slide imaging (WSI) is a digital imaging modality that uses computerized technology to scan and convert pathology and cytology glass slides into digital images (digital slides) that can be viewed remotely on a workstation using viewing software. In spite of the many advances, challenges remain such as the expensive initial set-up costs, workflow interruption, length of time to scan whole slides, large storage size for WSI, bandwidth restrictions, undefined legal implications, professional reluctance, and lack of standardization in the imaging process.},

abstract = {Background: Automatic multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation is a challenging task. An extensive analysis of the most recent techniques indicates an improvement of the results obtained when using prior knowledge and contextual information. New method: We present BOOST, a knowledge-based approach to automatically segment multiple sclerosis lesions through a voxel by voxel classification. We used the Gentleboost classifier and a set of features, including contextual features, registered atlas probability maps and an outlier map. Results: Results are computed on a set of 45 cases from three different hospitals (15 of each), obtaining a moderate agreement between the manual annotations and the automatically segmented results. Comparison with existing method(s): We quantitatively compared our results with three public state-of-the-art approaches obtaining competitive results and a better overlap with manual annotations. Our approach tends to better segment those cases with high lesion load, while cases with small lesion load are more difficult to accurately segment. Conclusions: We believe BOOST has potential applicability in the clinical practice, although it should be improved in those cases with small lesion load.},

abstract = {Segmented k-space acquisition of data was used to decrease the acquisition time and to increase the imaging resolution of the precise and accurate inversion recovery (PAIR) method of measuring T1. We validated the new TurboPAIR method by measuring T1 in 158 regions of interest in 12 volunteers, using both PAIR and TurboPAIR. We found a 3{\%} difference between methods, which could be corrected by linear regression. After validation, the TurboPAIR method was used to test a hypothesis that there is significant regional heterogeneity in cortical T1. We measured cortical gray matter T1 in 11 right-handed volunteers, in 48 regions of interest scattered over frontal and parietal cortex, and in 46 ROIs along the central sulcus (CS). We found that T1 in the CS is less than T1 elsewhere in the cortex (p {\textless} 0.001), and that there is considerable hemispheric asymmetry in T1 in gray matter, but not in white matter. In central gray structures (caudate, thalamus, nucleus pulvinarus), and in the posterior CS (sensory cortex), fight hemisphere T1 was significantly greater than left hemisphere T1 (p ≤ 0.004). In cortical gray matter of the frontal lobe and anterior CS (motor cortex), left hemisphere T1 was significantly greater than right hemisphere T1 (p ≤ 0.003). These findings demonstrate that there is considerable regional heterogeneity in human cortical T1 that is unexplained by differences in tissue iron content, but may be evidence of an inherent anatomic asymmetry of the brain.

Normal appearances and clinical examples in the central nervous system and the remainder of the body are used to illustrate the many options available with this sequence. The short TI IR sequence has advantages in magnetic resonance imaging of the body, and medium TI sequences are of value in localisation in the brain and in demonstrating contrast enhancement.

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has played a unique role in the diagnosis and management of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). In the recent years, there have been considerable changes in the diagnostic criteria for MS as MR-based studies demonstrated its power in earlier and more accurate diagnosis of the disease. Moreover, MRI metrics have become key supportive outcome measures to evaluate the efficacy of experimental treatments in randomized, controlled trials. MRI can also be used as a prognostic tool in patients with clinically isolated syndrome. Although advanced quantitative MRI measures such as magnetization transfer, spectroscopy, and diffusion imaging have added much more to our knowledge about pathogenesis and natural history of the disease but their cost, availability, complexity and lack of validation have limited their use in routine clinical practice. Conventional MR techniques including proton density, T1/T2-weighted images and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences are now accepted in standard protocols for diagnosis and treatment outcome measures in clinical trials for MS. The present review will focus on the type, morphology and evolution of MS lesions in conventional MRI and discusses their use for the monitoring of the disease both in daily clinical practice and experimental trials. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper provides an overview of cognitive impairment due to vascular brain damage, which is referred to as vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). Over the past decades, we have seen marked progress in detecting VCI, both through maturation of diagnostic concepts and through advances in brain imaging, especially MRI. Yet in daily practice, it is often challenging to establish the diagnosis, particularly in patients where there is no evident temporal relation between a cerebrovascular event and cognitive dysfunction. Because vascular damage is such a common cause of cognitive dysfunction, it provides an obvious target for treatment. In patients whose cognitive dysfunction follows directly after a stroke, the etiological classification of this stroke will direct treatment. In many patients however, VCI develops due to so-called “silent vascular damage,” without evident cerebrovascular events. In these patients, small vessel diseases (SVDs) are the most common cause. Yet no SVD-specific treatments currently exist, which is due to incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology. This review addresses developments in this field. It offers a framework to translate diagnostic criteria to daily practice, addresses treatment, and highlights some future perspectives.

We use the method in order to derive convergence bounds that improve significantly upon known spectral bounds. The core technical observation is that power-boundedness of transition maps of Markov chains enables a Wiener algebra functional calculus in order to upper bound any norm of any holomorphic function of the transition map. Finally, we discuss how general detailed balance conditions for quantum Markov processes lead to spectral convergence bounds.},

Through two examples, prostate cancer identification in biopsy specimens and breast cancer metastasis detection in sentinel lymph nodes, we show the potential of this new methodology to reduce the workload for pathologists, while at the same time increasing objectivity of diagnoses. We found that all slides containing prostate cancer and micro- and macro-metastases of breast cancer could be identified automatically while 30–40{\%} of the slides containing benign and normal tissue could be excluded without the use of any additional immunohistochemical markers or human intervention.

With this development over the last 20 years, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become one of the most important instruments in clinical diagnosis. In recent years, the greatest progress in further increasing imaging speed has been the development of parallel MRI (pMRI). Within the last 3 years, parallel imaging methods have become commercially available, and therefore are now available for a broad clinical use. The basic feature of pMRI is a scan time reduction, applicable to nearly any available MRI method, while maintaining the contrast behavior without requiring higher gradient system performance. Because of its faster image acquisition, pMRI can in some cases even significantly improve image quality. In the last 10 years of pMRI development, several different pMRI reconstruction methods have been set up which partially differ in their philosophy, in the mode of reconstruction as well in their advantages and drawbacks with regard to a successful image reconstruction. In this review, a brief overview is given on the advantages and disadvantages of present pMRI methods in clinical applications, and examples from different daily clinical applications are shown.},

abstract = {Vascular dysfunction has a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent data from brain imaging studies in humans and animal models suggest that cerebrovascular dysfunction may precede cognitive decline and onset of neurodegenerative changes in AD and AD models. Cerebral hypoperfusion and impaired amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) clearance across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may contribute to the onset and progression of dementia AD type. Decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) negatively affects the synthesis of proteins required for memory and learning, and may eventually lead to neuritic injury and neuronal death. Impaired clearance of Abeta from the brain by the cells of the neurovascular unit may lead to its accumulation on blood vessels and in brain parenchyma. The accumulation of Abeta on the cerebral blood vessels, known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), is associated with cognitive decline and is one of the hallmarks of AD pathology. CAA can severely disrupt the integrity of the blood vessel wall resulting in micro or macro intracerebral bleedings that exacerbates neurodegenerative process and inflammatory response and may lead to hemorrhagic stroke, respectively. Here, we review the role of the neurovascular unit and molecular mechanisms in vascular cells behind AD and CAA pathogenesis. First, we discuss apparent vascular changes, including the cerebral hypoperfusion and vascular degeneration that contribute to different stages of the disease process in AD individuals. We next discuss the role of the low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 (LRP), a key Abeta clearance receptor at the BBB and along the cerebrovascular system, whose expression is suppressed early in AD. We also discuss how brain-derived apolipoprotein E isoforms may influence Abeta clearance across the BBB. We then review the role of two interacting transcription factors, myocardin and serum response factor, in cerebral vascular cells in controlling CBF responses and LRP-mediated Abeta clearance. Finally, we discuss the role of microglia and perivascular macrophages in Abeta clearance from the brain.

abstract = {We have isolated and characterized the cDNA encoding a novel protein designated DJ-1. DJ-1, sharing no significant homology with the sequences so far reported, did not show transactivation activity in the Gal4 recombinant system, but transformed mouse NIH3T3 cells by itself. Furthermore, DJ-1 showed a cooperative transforming activity with H-Ras, more than 3 times as strong as the activity of ras/myc combination. DJ-1 was ubiquitously expressed in various human tissues, and the expression was induced by growth stimuli. Moreover, DJ-1 translocated from cytoplasm to nuclei in the S phase of the cell cycle. DJ-1 is thus suggested to be a novel mitogen-dependent oncogene product involved in a Ras-related signal transduction pathway.},

abstract = {With the increasing life expectancy in developed countries, the incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and thus its socioeconomic impact are growing. Increasing knowledge over the last years about the pathomechanisms involved in AD allow for the development of specific treatment strategies aimed at slowing down or even preventing neuronal death in AD. However, this requires also that (1) AD can be diagnosed with high accuracy, because non-AD dementias would not benefit from an AD-specific treatment; (2) AD can be diagnosed in very early stages when any intervention would be most effective; and (3) treatment efficacy can be reliably and meaningfully monitored. Although there currently is no ideal biomarker that would fulfill all these requirements, there is increasing evidence that a combination of currently existing neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood biomarkers can provide important complementary information and thus contribute to a more accurate and earlier diagnosis of AD. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is exploring which combinations of these biomarkers are the most powerful for diagnosis of AD and monitoring of treatment effects. ?? 2005 The Alzheimer's Association.

abstract = {The distinction between uterine serous and endometrioid carcinomas can usually be achieved by morphologic examination alone. However, there are occasional 'morphologically ambiguous endometrial carcinomas' that show overlapping serous and endometrioid features and defy histologic classification. The primary aim of this study was to assess the clinical significance of p53 overexpression using immunohistochemistry in such tumors. Related aims included (1) assessing interobserver diagnostic concordance for histologic subclassification of these tumors using a panel of pathologists with and without gynecologic pathology expertise and (2) elucidating the histologic features that correlate with p53 status. Thirty-five such cases were identified during the study period. p53 overexpression was seen in 17 of 35 cases. Tumors with p53 overexpression were associated with a significantly inferior progression-free survival and disease-specific survival compared with those that lacked p53 overexpression (3-year progression-free survival and disease-specific survival were 94 and 100{\%} in patients with no p53 overexpression, and 52 and 54{\%} in patients with p53 overexpression; P=0.02 and 0.003, respectively). The consensus diagnosis rendered by gynecologic pathologists was predictive of disease-specific survival (P=0.002), but not progression-free survival (P=0.11). Although the interobserver diagnostic concordance (kappa=0.70) was substantial for gynecologic pathologists, and highly associated with p53 status (77{\%} of 'favor serous' cases showed p53 overexpression, whereas only 25{\%} of 'favor endometrioid' cases showed p53 overexpression; P=0.005), the concordance between the consensus diagnosis of the two specialized pathologists versus each of three non-specialized pathologists was poor (kappa=0.13-0.25). The histologic feature that correlated most with p53 overexpression was the presence of diffuse high nuclear grade. p53 immunohistochemistry assays in morphologically ambiguous endometrial carcinomas are roughly as clinically informative as gynecologic pathology consultation and can be helpful for prognostic assessment and therapeutic decision making in difficult endometrial carcinomas.},

abstract = {Parkinson's disease is a neurological disorder with evolving layers of complexity. It has long been characterised by the classical motor features of parkinsonism associated with Lewy bodies and loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. However, the symptomatology of Parkinson's disease is now recognised as heterogeneous, with clinically significant non-motor features. Similarly, its pathology involves extensive regions of the nervous system, various neurotransmitters, and protein aggregates other than just Lewy bodies. The cause of Parkinson's disease remains unknown, but risk of developing Parkinson's disease is no longer viewed as primarily due to environmental factors. Instead, Parkinson's disease seems to result from a complicated interplay of genetic and environmental factors affecting numerous fundamental cellular processes. The complexity of Parkinson's disease is accompanied by clinical challenges, including an inability to make a definitive diagnosis at the earliest stages of the disease and difficulties in the management of symptoms at later stages. Furthermore, there are no treatments that slow the neurodegenerative process. In this Seminar, we review these complexities and challenges of Parkinson's disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We designed a Phase 3 clinical trial to determine the safety and efficacy of adding transcranial ultrasound using an operator-independent headframe to recombinant tissue-plasminogen-activator for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: Combined lysis of thrombus with ultrasound and systemic tissue-plasminogen-activator for emergent revascularization in acute ischemic stroke is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that will enroll subjects with the following main inclusion criteria: less than 4{\textperiodcentered}5 hours from symptom onset (three-hours in US and Canada), age 18-80 years, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score ≥ 10, and premorbid modified-Rankin-score of 0-1, eligibility for full dose recombinant tissue-plasminogen-activator. Subjects will receive two-hours of 2-MHz pulsed wave transcranial ultrasound (target group) or sham ultrasound (control group). The projected sample size is approximately 824 subjects. RESULTS: The primary endpoint, based on intention-to-treat criteria of patients enrolled within three-hours of symptom onset is the comparison between target and control groups of modified-Rankin-score scores at day 90 poststroke assessed using the proportional odds method. The study will have two planned interim analyses after approximately one-third and two-thirds of subjects have reached the 90-day modified-Rankin-score evaluation. Safety outcomes are symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 24 h and an overall analysis of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Since intravenous recombinant tissue-plasminogen-activator remains the only medical therapy to reverse ischemic stroke applicable in the emergency department, our trial will determine if the additional use of transcranial ultrasound improves functional outcomes in patients with severe acute ischemic stroke (NCT{\#}01098981).},

abstract = {Multiplex immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining is a new, emerging technique for the detection of multiple biomarkers within a single tissue section. The initial key step in multiplex IHC image analysis in digital pathology is of tremendous clinical importance due to its ability to accurately unmix the IHC image and differentiate each of the stains. The technique has become popular due to its significant efficiency and the rich diagnostic information it contains. The intriguing task of unmixing a three-channel CCD color camera acquired RGB image into more than three colors is very challenging, and to the best of our knowledge, hardly studied in academic literature. This paper presents a novel stain unmixing algorithm for brightfield multiplex IHC images based on a group sparsity model. The proposed framework achieves robust unmixing for more than three chromogenic dyes while preserving the biological constraints of the biomarkers. Typically, a number of biomarkers co-localize in the same cell parts named priori. With this biological information in mind, the number of stains at one pixel therefore has a fixed up-bound, i.e. equivalent to the number of co-localized biomarkers. By leveraging the group sparsity model, the fractions of stain contributions from the co-localized biomarkers are explicitly modeled into one group to yield the least square solution within the group. A sparse solution is obtained among the groups since ideally only one group of biomarkers is present at each pixel. The algorithm is evaluated on both synthetic and clinical data sets, and demonstrates better unmixing results than the existing strategies.},

abstract = {We sought to quantify CTP-derived infarct core applying previously published perfusion thresholds to multi-institutional CTP data to assess the margin of error for 25 mL and 70 mL critical volume thresholds using early DWI as a reference standard. 60 patients with acute ischemic stroke undergoing CTP and DWI within 6 and 24 h of symptom onset, respectively, were retrospectively analyzed from 3 tertiary care centers. CTP-derived infarct core was calculated using published thresholds for absolute and relative CBF and CBV in addition to manual CBV tracing. Using DWI as the reference standard, performance of CTP-derived measures of infarct core was assessed using co-registered voxel-by-voxel analysis and total infarct volume comparison. Volumes of each CTP infarct core estimate were compared against DWI to determine the degree of infarct core over or underestimation at the critical volumes of 25 mL and 70 mL. Median core infarct volume was 10.8 mL. Mean CTP-derived infarct core volumes were similar to DWI for all CTP threshold methods to within ± 1 mL. CBV tracing demonstrated an overall significant core overestimation compared to DWI (p = 0.017). All CTP core volume estimations showed robust correlation with DWI (Pearson p-value {\textless} 0.001). As core volume increased, CTP demonstrated increased deviation from DWI. At the critical cut-offs of 25 mL and 70 mL, relative CBF demonstrated the best agreement with DWI for infarct core compared to the other CTP-derived measures of infarct core. Our study demonstrates close approximation between multiple CTP-derived measures of infarct core and DWI infarct volume, Especially relative CBF.},

abstract = {Background: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) and covert brain in farcts (CBI) have been related to cognitive decline, dementia, stroke, and mortality. However, the relative importance of these associations and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In a large ongoing population-based study we assessed the relationship of WMH and CBI with subsequent mild cognitive impairment, dementia, stroke, and mortality. Methods: The sample comprised 2,229 Framingham Offspring Study participants (1,179 women, mean age at MRI: 62+/-9yrs) who underwent volumetric brain MRI (1999-2005). Dementia, stroke, and mortality were prospectively ascertained. These outcomes were related to the log-transformed ratio of WMH to total intracranial volumes (LWMHIV]), and presence of extensive WMH ({\textgreater}age-group specific mean[LWMHIV] + 1SD), CBI, or both, using age-, sex-adjusted Cox regression models; in secondary analyses we adjusted for vascular risk factors. In addition, the presence of mild cognitive impairment (amnestic [MCI-A] and executive-function [MCI-EF]) was assessed twice, at the time of the baseline MRI-scan, and 6.2+/-1.2yrs later: in multivariable logistic regression we related baseline WMH and CBI with MCI at the second neuropsychological examination, in participants free of MCI at baseline (n = 1,257). Results: 7 participants developed dementia (5 Alzheimer, 1 mixed, 1 vascular), 32 a stroke, 97 died; 141 participants developed new-onset MCI (68 MCI-A, 73 MCI-EF). LWMHIV was associated with an increased risk of MCI-EF (OR = 1.50,95{\%}CI[1.15-1.97], p = 0.003), incident dementia (HR = 2.72[1.38 5.33], p = 0.004) andmortality (HR = 1.43[1.18-7.73], p {\textless} 0.001), especially cardiovascular mortality (HR = 1.96[1.31-2.92], p = 0.001). Presence of extensive WMH was also strongly associated with these outcomes, and with incident stroke (HR = 2.33[1.04-5.21], p = 0.04). Presence of CBI predicted an in creased risk of MCI-EF (OR = 2.33[1.27-4.27], p = 0.006), stroke (HR = 3.06[1.44-6.51], p = 0.004), and mortality (HR = 1.73[1.08-2.78], p = 0.02). After adjustment for vascular risk factors, all the associations described Abetaove were unchanged, except the association of CBI with mortality which was no longer significant. Neither WMH nor CBI were associated with MCI-A. Conclusions: In a large community sample of middle-aged adults the presence of either WMH or CBI increased the risk of subsequent MCI-EF and dementia, CBI increased risk of incident stroke and extensive WMH was associated with increased mortality, emphasizing the value of these MRI measures as markers of cumulated vascular injury and predictors of adverse outcome independently of vascular risk factors.},

abstract = {The statistical properties of background noise such as its standard deviation and mean value are frequently used to estimate the original noise level of the acquired data. This requires the knowledge of the statistical intensity distribution of the background signal, that is, the probability density of the occurrence of a certain signal intensity. The influence of many new MRI techniques and, in particular, of various parallel-imaging methods on the noise statistics has neither been rigorously investigated nor experimentally demonstrated yet. In this study, the statistical distribution of background noise was analyzed for MR acquisitions with a single-channel and a 32-channel coil, with sum-of-squares (SoS) and spatial-matched-filter (SMF) data combination, with and without parallel imaging using k-space and image-domain algorithms, with real-part and conventional magnitude reconstruction and with several reconstruction filters. Depending on the imaging technique, the background noise could be described by a Rayleigh distribution, a noncentral chi-distribution or the positive half of a Gaussian distribution. In particular, the noise characteristics of SoS-reconstructed multichannel acquisitions (with k-space-based parallel imaging or without parallel imaging) differ substantially from those with image-domain parallel imaging or SMF combination. These effects must be taken into account if mean values or standard deviations of background noise are employed for data analysis such as determination of local noise levels. Assuming a Rayleigh distribution as in conventional MR images or a noncentral chi-distribution for all multichannel acquisitions is invalid in general and may lead to erroneous estimates of the signal-to-noise ratio or the contrast-to-noise ratio.},

abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation is crucial for evaluating disease burden, determining disease progression and measuring the impact of new clinical treatments. MS lesions can vary in size, location and intensity, making automatic segmentation challenging. In this paper, we propose a new supervised method to segment MS lesions from 3D magnetic resonance (MR) images using non-local means (NLM). The method uses a multi-channel and rotation-invariant distance measure to account for the diversity of MS lesions. The proposed segmentation method, rotation-invariant multi-contrast non-local means segmentation (RMNMS), captures the MS lesion spatial distribution and can accurately and robustly identify lesions regardless of their orientation, shape or size. An internal validation on a large clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset of MS patients demonstrated a good similarity measure result (Dice similarity = 60.1{\%} and sensitivity = 75.4{\%}), a strong correlation between expert and automatic lesion load volumes (R2 = 0.91), and a strong ability to detect lesions of different sizes and in varying spatial locations (lesion detection rate = 79.8{\%}). On the independent MS Grand Challenge (MSGC) dataset validation, our method provided competitive results with state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods. Qualitative visual and quantitative voxel- and lesion-wise evaluations demonstrated the accuracy of RMNMS method.},

abstract = {Staining and scanning of tissue samples for microscopic examination is fraught with undesirable color variations arising from differences in raw materials and manufacturing techniques of stain vendors, staining protocols of labs, and color responses of digital scanners. When comparing tissue samples, color normalization and stain separation of the tissue images can be helpful for both pathologists and software. Techniques that are used for natural images fail to utilize structural properties of stained tissue samples and produce undesirable color distortions. The stain concentration cannot be negative. Tissue samples are stained with only a few stains and most tissue regions are characterized by at most one effective stain. We model these physical phenomena that define the tissue structure by first decomposing images in an unsupervised manner into stain density maps that are sparse and non-negative. For a given image, we combine its stain density maps with stain color basis of a pathologist-preferred target image, thus altering only its color while preserving its structure described by the maps. Stain density correlation with ground truth and preference by pathologists were higher for images normalized using our method when compared to other alternatives. We also propose a computationally faster extension of this technique for large whole-slide images that selects an appropriate patch sample instead of using the entire image to compute the stain color basis.},

There was no significant difference (p = 0.31) in T(2) between WM (73 +/- 6 ms) and GM (76 +/- 3 ms) or between lateral and dorsal columns (lateral: 73 +/- 6 ms, dorsal: 72 +/- 7 ms, p = 0.59). WM relaxation times were similar to brain structures with very dense fiber packing (e.g., corpus callosum), while GM values resembled deep GM in brain. Optimized sequence parameters for maximal contrast between WM and GM, and between WM and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were derived. Since the spinal cord has rostral-caudal symmetry, we expect these findings to be applicable to the whole cord.},

abstract = {Explicit segmentation is required for many forms of quantitative neuroanatomic analysis. However, manual methods are time-consuming and subject to errors in both accuracy and reproducibility (precision). A 3-D model-based segmentation method is presented in this paper for the completely automatic identification and delineation of gross anatomical structures of the human brain based on their appearance in magnetic resonance images (MRI).The approach depends on a general, iterative, hierarchical non-linear registration procedure and a 3-D digital model of human brain anatomy that contains both volumetric intensity-based data and a geometric atlas. Here, the traditional segmentation strategy is inverted: instead of matching geometric contours from and idealized atlas directly to the MRI data, segmentation is achieved by identifying the non-linear spatial transformation that best maps corresponding intensity-based features between a model image and a new MRI brain volume. When completed, atlas contours defined on the model image are mapped through the same transformation to segment and label individual structures in the new data set.Using manually segmented sturcture boundaries for comparison, measures of volumetric difference and volumetric overlap were less than 2{\%} and better than 97{\%} for realistic brain phantom data, and less than 10{\%} and better than 85{\%}, respectively, for human MRI data. This compares favorably to intra-observer variability estimates of 4.9{\%} and 87{\%}, respectively. The procedure performs well, is objective and its implementation robust. The procedure requires no manual intervention, and is thus applicable to studies of large numbers of subjects. The general method for non-linear image matching is also useful for non-linear mapping of brain data sets into stereotaxic space if the target volume is already in stereotaxic space. {\textcopyright} 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Linear registration and motion correction are important components of structural and functional brain image analysis. Most modern methods optimize some intensity-based cost function to determine the best registration. To date, little attention has been focused on the optimization method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimization. This paper examines the optimization process in detail and demonstrates that the commonly used multiresolution local optimization methods can, and do, get trapped in local minima. To address this problem, two approaches are taken: (1) to apodize the cost function and (2) to employ a novel hybrid global-local optimization method. This new optimization method is specifically designed for registering whole brain images. It substantially reduces the likelihood of producing misregistrations due to being trapped by local minima. The increased robustness of the method, compared to other commonly used methods, is demonstrated by a consistency test. In addition, the accuracy of the registration is demonstrated by a series of experiments with motion correction. These motion correction experiments also investigate how the results are affected by different cost functions and interpolation methods. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

We present a modified expectation-maximisation algorithm to segment brain tissues (white matter, grey matter, and cerebro-spinal fluid) as well as a partial volume class containing fluid and grey matter. This algorithm provides an initial segmentation in which lesions are not separated from tissue, thus a second step is needed to find them. This second step involves the thresholding of the FLAIR image, followed by a regionwise refinement to discard false detections. To evaluate the proposal, we used a database with 45 cases comprising 1.5T imaging data from three different hospitals with different scanner machines and with a variable lesion load per case. The results for our database point out to a higher accuracy when compared to two of the best state-of-the-art approaches. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Brain extraction from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial for many neuroimaging workflows. Current methods demonstrate good results on non-enhanced T1-weighted images, but struggle when confronted with other modalities and pathologically altered tissue. In this paper we present a 3D convolutional deep learning architecture to address these shortcomings. In contrast to existing methods, we are not limited to non-enhanced T1w images. When trained appropriately, our approach handles an arbitrary number of modalities including contrast-enhanced scans. Its applicability to MRI data, comprising four channels: non-enhanced and contrast-enhanced T1w, T2w and FLAIR contrasts, is demonstrated on a challenging clinical data set containing brain tumors (N = 53), where our approach significantly outperforms six commonly used tools with a mean Dice score of 95.19. Further, the proposed method at least matches state-of-the-art performance as demonstrated on three publicly available data sets: IBSR, LPBA40 and OASIS, totaling N = 135 volumes. For the IBSR (96.32) and LPBA40 (96.96) data set the convolutional neuronal network (CNN) obtains the highest average Dice scores, albeit not being significantly different from the second best performing method. For the OASIS data the second best Dice (95.02) results are achieved, with no statistical difference in comparison to the best performing tool. For all data sets the highest average specificity measures are evaluated, whereas the sensitivity displays about average results. Adjusting the cut-off threshold for generating the binary masks from the CNN's probability output can be used to increase the sensitivity of the method. Of course, this comes at the cost of a decreased specificity and has to be decided application specific. Using an optimized GPU implementation predictions can be achieved in less than one minute. The proposed method may prove useful for large-scale studies and clinical trials.},

abstract = {Total intracranial volume (TIV/ICV) is an important covariate for volumetric analyses of the brain and brain regions, especially in the study of neurodegenerative diseases, where it can provide a proxy of maximum pre-morbid brain volume. The gold-standard method is manual delineation of brain scans, but this requires careful work by trained operators. We evaluated Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12) automated segmentation for TIV measurement in place of manual segmentation and also compared it with SPM8 and FreeSurfer 5.3.0. For T1-weighted MRI acquired from 288 participants in a multi-centre clinical trial in Alzheimer's disease we find a high correlation between SPM12 TIV and manual TIV (R2=0.940, 95{\%} Confidence Interval (0.924, 0.953)), with a small mean difference (SPM12 40.4??35.4ml lower than manual, amounting to 2.8{\%} of the overall mean TIV in the study). The correlation with manual measurements (the key aspect when using TIV as a covariate) for SPM12 was significantly higher (p2=0.577 CI (0.500, 0.644)) or FreeSurfer (R2=0.801 CI (0.744, 0.843)). These results suggest that SPM12 TIV estimates are an acceptable substitute for labour-intensive manual estimates even in the challenging context of multiple centres and the presence of neurodegenerative pathology. We also briefly discuss some aspects of the statistical modelling approaches to adjust for TIV.},

A smooth halo of periventricular hyperintensity has been linked to disruption of the ependymal lining with subependymal gliosis and concomitant loss of myelin. In contrast, punctate, early confluent and confluent hyperintensities in the deep and subcortical white matter as well as irregular periventricular hyperintensity appear to be of vascular origin. Punctate lesions tend to correspond to a perivascular reduction in myelin content with atrophy of the neuropil and seem to constitute a negligible extent of tissue damage from low permeability through thickened arteriolar walls. Early confluent and confluent hyperintensities, however, indicate more extensive ischemic damage consistent with advanced microangiopathy.},

abstract = {This paper presents an automatic lesion segmentation method based on similarities between multichannel patches. A patch database is built using training images for which the label maps are known. For each patch in the testing image, k similar patches are retrieved from the database. The matching labels for these k patches are then combined to produce an initial segmentation map for the test case. Finally an iterative patch-based label refinement process based on the initial segmentation map is performed to ensure the spatial consistency of the detected lesions. The method was evaluated in experiments on multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation in magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain. An evaluation was done for each image in the MICCAI 2008 MS lesion segmentation challenge. Results are shown to compete with the state of the art in the challenge. We conclude that the proposed algorithm for segmentation of lesions provides a promising new approach for local segmentation and global detection in medical images.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE White matter lesions are often seen on MR scans of elderly non-demented and demented people. They are attributed to degenerative changes of small vessels and are implicated in the pathogenesis of cognitive decline and dementia. There is evidence that especially periventricular white matter lesions are related to cognitive decline, whereas subcortical white matter lesions may be related to late onset depression. The frequency distribution of subcortical and periventricular white matter lesions according to age and sex reported. METHODS A total of 1077 subjects aged between 60–90 years were randomly sampled from the general population. All subjects underwent 1.5T MR scanning; white matter lesions were rated separately for the subcortical region and the periventricular region. RESULTS Of all subjects 8{\%} were completely free of subcortical white matter lesions, 20{\%} had no periventricular white matter lesions, and 5{\%} had no white matter lesions in either of these locations. The proportion with white matter lesions increased with age, similarly for men and women. Women tended to have more subcortical white matter lesions than men (total volume 1.45 ml v 1.29 ml; p=0.33), mainly caused by marked differences in the frontal white matter lesion volume (0.89 ml v 0.70 ml; p=0.08). Periventricular white matter lesions were also more frequent among women than men (mean grade 2.5 v 2.3; p=0.07). Also severe degrees of subcortical white matter lesions were more common in women than in men (OR 1.1; 95{\%} confidence interval (95{\%} CI) 0.8–1.5) and periventricular white matter lesions (OR 1.2; 95{\%} CI 0.9–1.7), albeit that none of these findings were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence and the degree of cerebral white matter lesions increased with age. Women tended to have a higher degree of white matter lesions than men. This may underlie the finding of a higher incidence of dementia in women than in men, particularly at later age.},

abstract = {This paper discusses a white matter lesion (WML) segmentation scheme for fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI. The method computes the volume of lesions with subvoxel precision by accounting for the partial volume averaging (PVA) artifact. As WMLs are related to stroke and carotid disease, accurate volume measurements are most important. Manual volume computation is laborious, subjective, time consuming, and error prone. Automated methods are a nice alternative since they quantify WML volumes in an objective, efficient, and reliable manner. PVA is initially modeled with a localized edge strength measure since PVA resides in the boundaries between tissues. This map is computed in 3-D and is transformed to a global representation to increase robustness to noise. Significant edges correspond to PVA voxels, which are used to find the PVA fraction alpha (amount of each tissue present in mixture voxels). Results on simulated and real FLAIR images show high WML segmentation performance compared to ground truth (98.9{\%} and 83{\%} overlap, respectively), which outperforms other methods. Lesion load studies are included that automatically analyze WML volumes for each brain hemisphere separately. This technique does not require any distributional assumptions/parameters or training samples and is applied on a single MR modality, which is a major advantage compared to the traditional methods.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patient delays in seeking treatment for stroke and delays within the Emergency Department (ED) are major factors in the lack of use of thrombolytic therapy for stroke. The Genentech Stroke Presentation Survey was a multicentered prospective registry of patients with acute stroke. The study was designed to characterize prehospital delays and delays within the ED. METHODS: Patients with stroke symptoms presenting to 48 EDs participating in a clinical trial of acute stroke therapy were enrolled prospectively. A 1-page data form was completed from patient interviews and medical records. RESULTS: A total of 1207 subjects were entered into the study. Ninety-four percent of the 721 subjects with complete data had a diagnosis of stroke or transient ischemic attack, 13{\%} were black, 50{\%} were female, and 67{\%} were aged {\textgreater}65 years. The median time from symptom onset to ED arrival was 2.6 (interquartile range 1.2 to 6.3) hours. The median time from ED arrival until CT scan completion was 1.1 (0.7 to 1.8) hours, and the total delay time (symptom onset until CT scan completion) had a median of 4.0 (2.3 to 8.3) hours. Patients who arrived by emergency medical services had significantly shorter prehospital delay times and times to CT scan. Age, race, sex, and educational level did not appear to affect prehospital delay times. CONCLUSIONS: Despite its limitations, this large geographically diverse study strongly suggests that the use of emergency medical services is an important modifiable determinant of delay time for the treatment of acute stroke.},

More and more, the question asked by clinicians is how much and where, rather than a simple statement on the presence or absence of abnormalities. The authors present a study in which the results obtained with a semiautomatic, multispectral segmentation technique are quantitatively compared to manually delineated regions. The core of the semiautomatic image analysis system is a supervised artificial neural network classifier augmented with dedicated preand postprocessing algorithms, including anisotropic noise filtering and a surface-fitting method for the correction of spatial intensity variations. The study was focused on the quantitation of white matter lesions in the human brain. A total of 36 images from six brain volumes was analyzed twice by each of two operators, under supervision of a neuroradiologist. Both the intra- and interrater variability of the methods were studied in terms of the average tissue area detected per slice, the correlation coefficients between area measurements, and a measure of similarity derived from the kappa statistic. The results indicate that, compared to a manual method, the use of the semiautomatic technique not only facilitates the analysis of the images, but also has similar or lower intra- and interrater variabilities.},

abstract = {Purpose: To investigate associations between neuroimaging markers of cerebrovascular disease, including lesion topography and extent and severity of strategic and global cerebral tissue injury, and cognition in carotid artery disease (CAD). Materials and Methods: All participants gave written informed consent to undergo brain magnetic resonance imaging and the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination–Revised. One hundred eight patients with symptomatic CAD but no dementia were included, and a score less than 82 represented cognitive impairment. Group comparison and interrelations between global cognitive and ﬂuency performance, lesion topography, and ultrastructural damage were assessed with voxelbased statistics. Associations between cognition, medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA), lesion volumes, and global white matter ultrastructural damage indexed as increased mean diffusivity were tested with regression analysis by controlling for age. Diagnostic accuracy of imaging markers selected from a multivariate prediction model was tested with receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results: Cognitively impaired patients (n = 53 [49.1{\%}], classifed as having probable vascular cognitive disorder) were older than nonimpaired patients (P = .027) and had more frequent MTA (P {\textless} .001), more cortical infarctions (P = .016), and larger volumes of acute (P = .028) and chronic (P = .009) subcortical ischemic lesions. Lesion volumes did not correlate with global cognitive performance (lacunar infarctions, P = .060; acute lesions, P = .088; chronic subcortical ischemic lesions, P = .085). In contrast, cognitive performance correlated with presence of chronic ischemic lesions within the interhemispheric tracts and thalamic radiation (P {\textless} .05, false discovery rate corrected). Skeleton mean diffusivity showed the closest correlation with cognition (R2 = 0.311, P {\textless} .001) and promising diagnostic accuracy for vascular cognitive disorder (area under the curve, 0.82 [95{\%} confdence interval: 0.75, 0.90]). Findings were confrmed in subjects with a low risk of preclinical Alzheimer disease indexed by the absence of MTA (n = 85). Conclusion: Subcortical white matter ischemic lesion locations and severity of ultrastructural tract damage contribute to cognitive impairment in symptomatic CAD, which suggests that subcortical disconnection within large-scale cognitive neural networks is a key mechanism of vascular cognitive disorder.},

abstract = {L1 regularized logistic regression is now a workhorse of machine learning: it is widely used for many classification problems, particularly ones with many features. L1 regularized logistic regression requires solving a convex optimization problem. However, standard algorithms for solving convex optimization problems do not scale well enough to handle the large datasets encountered in many practical settings. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for L1 regularized logistic regression. Our algorithm iteratively approximates the objective function by a quadratic approximation at the current point, while maintaining the L1 constraint. In each iteration, it uses the efficient LARS (Least Angle Regression) algorithm to solve the resulting L1 constrained quadratic optimization problem. Our theoretical results show that our algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the global optimum. Our experiments show that our algorithm significantly outperforms standard algorithms for solving convex optimization problems. Moreover, our algorithm outperforms four previously published algorithms that were specifically designed to solve the L1 regularized logistic regression problem.},

We analyze the accuracy of gray and white matter volume measurements and their robustness against changes of image quality using the BrainWeb MRI database. These images are based on "gold-standard" reference brain templates. This allows us to assess between- (same data set, different method) and also within-segmenter (same method, variation of image quality) comparability, for both of which we find pronounced variations in segmentation results for gray and white matter volumes. The calculated volumes deviate up to {\textgreater}10{\%} from the reference values for gray and white matter depending on method and image quality. Sensitivity is best for SPM5, volumetric accuracy for gray and white matter was similar in SPM5 and FSL and better than in FreeSurfer. FSL showed the highest stability for white ({\textless}5{\%}), FreeSurfer (6.2{\%}) for gray matter for constant image quality BrainWeb data. Between-segmenter comparisons show discrepancies of up to {\textgreater}20{\%} for the simulated data and 24{\%} on average for the real data sets, whereas within-method performance analysis uncovered volume differences of up to {\textgreater}15{\%}. Since the discrepancies between results reach the same order of magnitude as volume changes observed in disease, these effects limit the usability of the segmentation methods for following volume changes in individual patients over time and should be taken into account during the planning and analysis of brain volume studies.},

Objective: To characterize cross-sectionally and longitudinally clinical measures in normal controls, subjects with MCI, and subjects with mild Alzheimer disease (AD) to enable the assessment of the utility of neuroimaging and chemical biomarker measures. Methods: A total of 819 subjects (229 cognitively normal, 398 with MCI, and 192 with AD) were enrolled at baseline and followed for 12 months using standard cognitive and functional measures typical of clinical trials. Results: The subjects with MCI were more memory impaired than the cognitively normal subjects but not as impaired as the subjects with AD. Nonmemory cognitive measures were only minimally impaired in the subjects with MCI. The subjects with MCI progressed to dementia in 12 months at a rate of 16.5{\%} per year. Approximately 50{\%} of the subjects with MCI were on antidementia therapies. There was minimal movement on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale for the normal control subjects, slight movement for the subjects with MCI of 1.1, and a modest change for the subjects with AD of 4.3. Baseline CSF measures of A{\{}beta{\}}-42 separated the 3 groups as expected and successfully predicted the 12-month change in cognitive measures. Conclusion: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative has successfully recruited cohorts of cognitively normal subjects, subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and subjects with Alzheimer disease with anticipated baseline characteristics.

abstract = {Background Up-to-date evidence about levels and trends in disease and injury incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) is an essential input into global, regional, and national health policies. In the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013), we estimated these quantities for acute and chronic diseases and injuries for 188 countries between 1990 and 2013. Methods Estimates were calculated for disease and injury incidence, prevalence, and YLDs using GBD 2010 methods with some important refinements. Results for incidence of acute disorders and prevalence of chronic disorders are new additions to the analysis. Key improvements include expansion to the cause and sequelae list, updated systematic reviews, use of detailed injury codes, improvements to the Bayesian meta-regression method (DisMod-MR), and use of severity splits for various causes. An index of data representativeness, showing data availability, was calculated for each cause and impairment during three periods globally and at the country level for 2013. In total, 35 620 distinct sources of data were used and documented to calculated estimates for 301 diseases and injuries and 2337 sequelae. The comorbidity simulation provides estimates for the number of sequelae, concurrently, by individuals by country, year, age, and sex. Disability weights were updated with the addition of new population-based survey data from four countries. Findings Disease and injury were highly prevalent; only a small fraction of individuals had no sequelae. Comorbidity rose substantially with age and in absolute terms from 1990 to 2013. Incidence of acute sequelae were predominantly infectious diseases and short-term injuries, with over 2 billion cases of upper respiratory infections and diarrhoeal disease episodes in 2013, with the notable exception of tooth pain due to permanent caries with more than 200 million incident cases in 2013. Conversely, leading chronic sequelae were largely attributable to non-communicable diseases, with prevalence estimates for asymptomatic permanent caries and tension-type headache of 2??4 billion and 1??6 billion, respectively. The distribution of the number of sequelae in populations varied widely across regions, with an expected relation between age and disease prevalence. YLDs for both sexes increased from 537??6 million in 1990 to 764??8 million in 2013 due to population growth and ageing, whereas the age-standardised rate decreased little from 114??87 per 1000 people to 110??31 per 1000 people between 1990 and 2013. Leading causes of YLDs included low back pain and major depressive disorder among the top ten causes of YLDs in every country. YLD rates per person, by major cause groups, indicated the main drivers of increases were due to musculoskeletal, mental, and substance use disorders, neurological disorders, and chronic respiratory diseases; however HIV/AIDS was a notable driver of increasing YLDs in sub-Saharan Africa. Also, the proportion of disability-adjusted life years due to YLDs increased globally from 21??1{\%} in 1990 to 31??2{\%} in 2013. Interpretation Ageing of the world's population is leading to a substantial increase in the numbers of individuals with sequelae of diseases and injuries. Rates of YLDs are declining much more slowly than mortality rates. The non-fatal dimensions of disease and injury will require more and more attention from health systems. The transition to non-fatal outcomes as the dominant source of burden of disease is occurring rapidly outside of sub-Saharan Africa. Our results can guide future health initiatives through examination of epidemiological trends and a better understanding of variation across countries.},

abstract = {Rationale and Objectives: To prospectively compare the image contrast of various brain lesions on two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) images and to highlight the pitfalls of 3D FLAIR. Materials and Methods: Institutional review board approval was obtained. We examined 94 brain lesions with 2D and 3D FLAIR at 3T. First, we optimized the repetition time and echo time of 3D FLAIR with a volunteer study. Then, we assessed the conspicuity and detection of the various lesions qualitatively, and the contrast ratio between the gray or white matter and lesions was calculated as a quantitative assessment. We also performed a phantom study to investigate the effects of different flow velocities on 2D and 3D FLAIR. Results: With regard to the conspicuity and detection of most lesions (multiple sclerosis, ischemic lesions or infarction, brain tumors, or chronic trauma), 3D FLAIR was equal or superior to 2D FLAIR. For these lesions, the mean contrast ratios were higher on 3D FLAIR than on 2D FLAIR images. In terms of lesion conspicuity in the patients with hippocampal sclerosis and leptomeningeal metastasis, however, 3D FLAIR was equal or inferior to 2D FLAIR. The ivy sign in patients with moyamoya disease was frequently obscured on 3D FLAIR. The phantom study demonstrated that the signal-intensity ratio on 3D FLAIR decreased more rapidly with increasing velocity than that on 2D FLAIR. Conclusion: Although 3D FLAIR may replace 2D FLAIR images for most patients, radiologists should keep in mind that 3D has some pitfalls. ?? 2012 AUR.},

abstract = {The spatial relation "between" is a notion which is intrinsically both fuzzy and contextual, and depends, in particular, on the shape of the objects. The literature is quite poor on this and the few existing definitions do not take into account these aspects. In particular, an object B that is in a concavity of an object A1 not visible from an object A2 is considered between A1 and A2 for most definitions, which is counter intuitive. Also, none of the definitions deal with cases where one object is much more elongated than the other. Here, we propose definitions which are based on convexity, morphological operators, and separation tools, and a fuzzy notion of visibility. They correspond to the main intuitive exceptions of the relation. We distinguish between cases where objects have similar spatial extensions and cases where one object is much more extended than the other. Extensions to cases where objects, themselves, are fuzzy and to three-dimensional space are proposed as well. The original work proposed in this paper covers the main classes of situations and overcomes the limits of existing approaches, particularly concerning nonvisible concavities and extended objects. Moreover, the definitions capture the intrinsic imprecision attached to this relation. The main proposed definitions are illustrated on real data from medical images.},

abstract = {Purpose To determine suitable features and optimal classifier design for a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to differentiate among mass and nonmass enhancements during dynamic contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the breast. Materials and Methods Two hundred eighty histologically proved mass lesions and 129 histologically proved nonmass lesions from MR imaging studies were retrospectively collected. The institutional research ethics board approved this study and waived informed consent. Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System classification of mass and nonmass enhancement was obtained from radiologic reports. Image data from dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging were extracted and analyzed by using feature selection techniques and binary, multiclass, and cascade classifiers. Performance was assessed by measuring the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. Bootstrap cross validation was used to predict the best classifier for the classification task of mass and nonmass benign and malignant breast lesions. Results A total of 176 features were extracted. Feature relevance ranking indicated unequal importance of kinetic, texture, and morphologic features for mass and nonmass lesions. The best classifier performance was a two-stage cascade classifier (mass vs nonmass followed by malignant vs benign classification) (AUC, 0.91; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.88, 0.94) compared with one-shot classifier (ie, all benign vs malignant classification) (AUC, 0.89; 95{\%} CI: 0.85, 0.92). The AUC was 2{\%} higher for cascade (median percent difference obtained by using paired bootstrapped samples) and was significant (P = .0027). Our proposed two-stage cascade classifier decreases the overall misclassification rate by 12{\%}, with 72 of 409 missed diagnoses with cascade versus 82 of 409 missed diagnoses with one-shot classifier. Conclusion Separately optimizing feature selection and training classifiers for mass and nonmass lesions improves the accuracy of CAD for breast MR imaging. By cascading classifiers, we achieved a significant improvement in performance with respect to the use of a one-shot classifier. Our cascaded classifier may provide an advantage for screening women at high risk for breast cancer, in whom the ability to diagnose cancers at an early stage is of primary importance.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Moderate correlation exists between the imaging quantification of brain white matter lesions and cognitive performance in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). This may reflect the greater importance of other features, including subvisible pathology, or methodological limitations of the primary literature.$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: To summarise the cognitive clinico-radiological paradox and explore the potential methodological factors that could influence the assessment of this relationship.$\backslash$nMETHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of primary research relating cognitive function to white matter lesion burden.$\backslash$nRESULTS: Fifty papers met eligibility criteria for review, and meta-analysis of overall results was possible in thirty-two (2050 participants). Aggregate correlation between cognition and T2 lesion burden was r = -0.30 (95{\%} confidence interval: -0.34, -0.26). Wide methodological variability was seen, particularly related to key factors in the cognitive data capture and image analysis techniques.$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Resolving the persistent clinico-radiological paradox will likely require simultaneous evaluation of multiple components of the complex pathology using optimum measurement techniques for both cognitive and MRI feature quantification. We recommend a consensus initiative to support common standards for image analysis in MS, enabling benchmarking while also supporting ongoing innovation.},

abstract = {PURPOSE To optimize a T1-weighted fast fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence using computer-simulated data and to study its clinical utility for imaging the spine. METHODS Relative signal intensities and contrast of relevant normal and pathologic tissues in the spine were computed using an inversion recovery equation modified to account for a hybrid RARE (rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement) readout. A range of inversion time (TI) and repetition time (TR) pairs that null the signal from CSF was generated. A contrast-optimized heavily T1-weighted fast FLAIR sequence, based on the generated data, was qualitatively compared with conventional T1-weighted spin-echo sequences for imaging various spinal abnormalities. RESULTS A T1/TR pair of approximately 862/2000 was extracted from the computer-generated data to produce effective nulling of CSF signal, to achieve heavy T1 weighting, and to optimize contrast between abnormal tissues and cord/bone marrow. Clinical implementation of the optimized T1-weighted fast FLAIR sequence revealed superior contrast at the CSF-cord interface, better conspicuity of lesions of the spinal cord and bone marrow, and reduced hardware-related artifacts as compared with conventional T1-weighted spin-echo sequences. CONCLUSION The optimized T1-weighted fast FLAIR technique has definite advantages over spin-echo sequences for imaging the spine. Comparable acquisition times render the FLAIR sequence the method of choice for T1-weighted imaging of the spine.},

abstract = {The segmentation of MRI scans of patients with white matter lesions (WML) is difficult because the MRI characteristics of WML are similar to those of gray matter. Intensity-based statistical classification techniques misclassify some WML as gray matter and some gray matter as WML. We developed a fast elastic matching algorithm that warps a reference data set containing information about the location of the gray matter into the approximate shape of the patient's brain. The region of white matter was segmented after segmenting the cortex and deep gray matter structures. The cortex was identified by using a three-dimensional, region-growing algorithm that was constrained by anatomical, intensity gradient, and tissue class parameters. White matter and WML were then segmented without interference from gray matter by using a two-class minimum-distance classifier. Analysis of double-echo spin-echo MRI scans of 16 patients with clinically determined multiple sclerosis (MS) was carried out. The segmentation of the cortex and deep gray matter structures provided anatomical context. This was found to improve the segmentation of MS lesions by allowing correct classification of the white matter region despite the overlapping tissue class distributions of gray matter and MS lesion.},

Although the individual concepts are simple, there are many concepts to learn and retain simultaneously; this situation may give the illusion that learning the physics of MR imaging is complicated. It is important for the radiologist who interprets MR images to understand the methods used to create the images because image contrast specifically depends on how the image data were acquired. Initial concepts include formation of magnetic fields from electric currents in loops of wire, the resonance phenomenon, the hydrogen proton and its frequency of precession, and absorption of radiofrequency energy. These concepts can then be applied to learn about T1 and T2 relaxation and contrast and how the acquisition parameters of echo time and repetition time can be used to achieve these image contrasts. Basic pulse sequences include the spin-echo, multiecho spin-echo, turbo spin-echo, inversion-recovery, and gradient-recalled-echo sequences.},

abstract = {It is very important to detect stages of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions in order to exactly quantify involved voxels. In this paper, a novel method is proposed for automatic detection of different stages of MS lesions in the brain magnetic resonance (MR) images, in fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) studies. In the proposed method, firstly, MS lesion voxels are segmented in FLAIR images based on adaptive mixtures method (AMM) and Markov Random Field (MRF) model. Then, signal intensity of each lesion voxel is modeled as a linear combination of signals related to the normal and also abnormal parts, in the voxel. By applying an optimal threshold, voxels with new intensities are primarily classified into two stages: previously destructed (chronic) and on going destruction (acute) lesions. Finally, the acute lesions, according to their activities, are classified, by another optimal threshold, into two new stages, early and recent acute. Evaluation of the proposed method was performed by manual segmentation of chronic and enhanced (early) acute lesions in gadolinium enhanced T1-weighted (Gad-E-T1-w) images by studying T1-weighted (T1-w) and T2-weighted (T2-w) images, using similarity criteria. The results showed a good correlation between the lesions segmented by the proposed method and by experts manually. Thus, the suggested method is useful to reduce the need for paramagnetic materials in contrast enhanced MR imaging which is a routine procedure for separation of acute and chronic lesions.},

abstract = {Probabilities play a central role in modern pattern recognition. We have seen in Chapter 1 that probability theory can be expressed in terms of two simple equations corresponding to the sum rule and the product rule. All of the probabilistic inference and learning manipulations discussed in this book, no matter how complex, amount to repeated application of these two equations. We could therefore proceed to formulate and solve complicated probabilistic models purely by algebraic manipulation. However, we shall find it highly advantageous to augment the analysis using diagrammatic representations of probability distributions, called probabilistic graphical models. These offer several useful properties: 1. They provide a simple way to visualize the structure of a probabilistic model and can be used to design and motivate new models. 2. Insights into the properties of the model, including conditional independence properties, can be obtained by inspection of the graph. 3. Complex computations, required to perform inference and learning in sophisticated models, can be expressed in terms of graphical manipulations, in which underlying mathematical expressions are carried along implicitly. A graph comprises nodes (also called vertices) connected by links (also known as edges or arcs). In a probabilistic graphical model, each node represents a random variable (or group of random variables), and the links express probabilistic relationships between these variables. The graph then captures the way in which the joint distribution over all of the random variables can be decomposed into a product of factors each depending only on a subset of the variables. We shall begin by discussing Bayesian networks, also known as directed graphical models, in which the links of the graphs have a particular directionality indicated by arrows. The other major class of graphical models are Markov random fields, also known as undirected graphical models, in which the links do not carry arrows and have no directional significance. Directed graphs are useful for expressing causal relationships between random variables, whereas undirected graphs are better suited to expressing soft constraints between random variables. For the purposes of solving inference problems, it is often convenient to convert both directed and undirected graphs into a different representation called a factor graph. In this chapter, we shall focus on the key aspects of graphical models as needed for applications in pattern recognition and machine learning. More general treatments of graphical models can be found in the books by Whittaker (1990), Lauritzen (1996), Jensen (1996), Castillo et al. (1997), Jordan (1999), Cowell et al. (1999), and Jordan (2007).},

abstract = {Small vessel disease (SVD) and amyloid deposition may promote each other, with a potential association between SVD and altered production or clearance of $\beta$-amyloid (A$\beta$) affecting its cleavage products. We investigated the relationship between SVD, multiple isoforms of A$\beta$ in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cortical A$\beta$ in 831 subjects with cognitive performance ranging from normal to Alzheimer's disease (AD) (the Swedish BioFINDER study). SVD was estimated as white matter lesions (WML) and lacunes. 18F-flutemetamol PET was performed in 321 subjects. Lower CSF levels of A$\beta$38 and A$\beta$40 were consistently associated with increased WML in all subgroups, while lower levels of CSF A$\beta$42 were associated with WML mainly in AD. CSF A$\beta$38 and A$\beta$40 were associated with regional WML in all regions, while CSF A$\beta$42 was associated with temporal WML only. A composite measure of 18F-flutemetamol uptake was not associated with WML, and regional 18F-flutemetamol uptake only with temporal WML. Lacunes were not associated with A$\beta$ isoforms nor 18F-flutemetamol uptake. Our results suggest that WML may be associated with alterations in the production or clearance of A$\beta$ species, particularly of A$\beta$38 and A$\beta$40. However, in AD cases, A$\beta$42 pathology might be associated with WML, especially in the temporal lobe.},

abstract = {There is suggestion that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence may be more accurate than T2 images in detecting white matter lesions (WML) in older people. Comparative ratings of these two image sequences have not been directly investigated in very old individuals to date. We compared the ratings of periventricular and deep WML on these two sequences in a sample of 111 community dwellers (mean age 85.5 years) using semiquantitative methods. Periventricular WML were as commonly detected on T2 as on FLAIR but were more severely rated on the latter sequence. No such bias was observed for the deep WML. With one exception, correlations between the two sets of measures were significant at the P {\textless} 0.001 level (range: 0.34-0.75). Intrarater reliability coefficients were moderate to excellent for most ratings. These results suggest that ratings performed on T2-weighted images to detect WML in very old individuals are very comparable with those performed on FLAIR images although FLAIR may allow a finer grading of periventricular lesions. Absence of FLAIR does not preclude the identification of WML in this population. These findings have clinical and epidemiological relevance where the acquisition of supplementary MRI data may not always be possible.},

All single-slab 3D sequences and 2D-T2SE were acquired in 16 MS patients and 9 age-matched healthy controls. Lesions were scored independently by two raters and characterized anatomically. Two-tailed Bonferroni-corrected Student's t-tests were used to detect differences in lesion detection between the various sequences per anatomical area after log-transformation. In general, signal and contrast properties of the 3D sequences enabled improved detection of MS brain lesions compared to 2D-T2SE. Specifically, 3D-DIR showed the highest detection of intracortical and mixed WM-GM lesions, whereas 3D-FLAIR showed the highest total number of WM lesions. Both 3D-DIR and 3D-FLAIR showed the highest number of infratentorial lesions. 3D-T2 and 3D-MPRAGE did not improve lesion detection compared to 2D-T2SE. Multi-contrast, isotropic, single-slab 3D MRI allowed an improved detection of both GM and WM lesions compared to 2D-T2SE.

abstract = {Whole brain computed tomography perfusion (CTP) has the potential to select eligible patients for reperfusion therapy. We aimed to find the optimal thresholds on baseline CTP for ischemic core and penumbra in acute ischemic stroke. We reviewed patients with acute ischemic stroke in the anterior circulation, who underwent baseline whole brain CTP, followed by intravenous thrombolysis and perfusion imaging at 24 hours. Patients were divided into those with major reperfusion (to define the ischemic core) and minimal reperfusion (to define the extent of penumbra). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and volumetric consistency analysis were performed separately to determine the optimal threshold by Youden's Index and mean magnitude of volume difference, respectively. From a series of 103 patients, 22 patients with minimal-reperfusion and 47 with major reperfusion were included. Analysis revealed delay time ≥ 3 s most accurately defined penumbra (AUC = 0.813; 95{\%} CI, 0.812-0.814, mean magnitude of volume difference = 29.1 ml). The optimal threshold for ischemic core was rCBF ≤ 30{\%} within delay time ≥ 3 s (AUC = 0.758; 95{\%} CI, 0.757-0.760, mean magnitude of volume difference = 10.8 ml). In conclusion, delay time ≥ 3 s and rCBF ≤ 30{\%} within delay time ≥ 3 s are the optimal thresholds for penumbra and core, respectively. These results may allow the application of the mismatch on CTP to reperfusion therapy.},

A common case in which this does not hold is when the data come from multiple sources, in the sense used in transfer learning. In this case it is common to arrange the cross-validation procedure in a way that takes the source structure into account. Although common in practice, this procedure does not appear to have been theoretically analysed. We present new estimators of the variance of the cross-validation, both in the multiple-source setting and in the standard iid setting. These new estimators allow for much more accurate confidence intervals and hypothesis tests to compare algorithms.},

abstract = {Parallel imaging reconstructions result in spatially varying noise amplification characterized by the g-factor, precluding conventional measurements of noise from the final image. A simple Monte Carlo based method is proposed for all linear image reconstruction algorithms, which allows measurement of signal-to-noise ratio and g-factor and is demonstrated for SENSE and GRAPPA reconstructions for accelerated acquisitions that have not previously been amenable to such assessment. Only a simple "prescan" measurement of noise amplitude and correlation in the phased-array receiver, and a single accelerated image acquisition are required, allowing robust assessment of signal-to-noise ratio and g-factor. The "pseudo multiple replica" method has been rigorously validated in phantoms and in vivo, showing excellent agreement with true multiple replica and analytical methods. This method is universally applicable to the parallel imaging reconstruction techniques used in clinical applications and will allow pixel-by-pixel image noise measurements for all parallel imaging strategies, allowing quantitative comparison between arbitrary k-space trajectories, image reconstruction, or noise conditioning techniques.},

This paper attempts to review some of the recent developments in the mathematical modeling of IIH field. Low frequency models are widely used, but they tend to corrupt the low-frequency components of the tissue. Hypersurface models and statistical models can be adaptive to the image and generally more stable, but they are also generally more complex and consume more computer memory and CPU time. They are often formulated together with image segmentation within one framework and the overall performance is highly dependent on the segmentation process. Beside these three popular models, this paper also summarizes other techniques based on different principles. In addition, the issue of quantitative evaluation and comparative study are discussed.},

The MR parameters were compared to those at 1.5 T. As expected, the T2 relaxation time constants and quantitative MT parameters (MT exchange rate, R, macromolecular pool fraction, M0B, and macromolecular T2 relaxation time, T2B) at 3 T were similar to those at 1.5 T. The T1 relaxation time values, however, for all measured tissues increased significantly with field strength. Consequently, the phenomenological MT parameter, magnetization transfer ratio, MTR, was lower by approximately 2 to 10{\%}. Collectively, these results provide a useful reference for optimization of pulse sequence parameters for MRI at 3 T.},

abstract = {Detection and classification of cell nuclei in histopathology images of cancerous tissue stained with the standard hematoxylin and eosin stain is a challenging task due to cellular heterogeneity. Deep learning approaches have been shown to produce encouraging results on histopathology images in various studies. In this paper, we propose a Spatially Constrained Convolutional Neural Network (SC-CNN) to perform nucleus detection. SC-CNN regresses the likelihood of a pixel being the center of a nucleus, where high probability values are spatially constrained to locate in the vicinity of the center of nuclei. For classification of nuclei, we propose a novel Neighboring Ensemble Predictor (NEP) coupled with CNN to more accurately predict the class label of detected cell nuclei. The proposed approaches for detection and classification do not require segmentation of nuclei. We have evaluated them on a large dataset of colorectal adenocarcinoma images, consisting of more than 20,000 annotated nuclei belonging to four different classes. Our results show that the joint detection and classification of the proposed SC-CNN and NEP produces the highest average F1 score as compared to other recently published approaches. Prospectively, the proposed methods could offer benefit to pathology practice in terms of quantitative analysis of tissue constituents in whole-slide images, and could potentially lead to a better understanding of cancer.},

@article{Roberts2007,
abstract = {Clinical MRI depends on a symbiosis between MR physics and clinical requirements. The imaging solutions are based on a balance between the "palette" of available image contrasts derived from nuclear spin physics and tissue biophysics, and clinical determinants such as the anticipated pathology and efficient use of imaging time. Imaging is therefore optimized to maximize diagnostic sensitivity and specificity through the development of protocols organized along the lines of major disease categories. In the other part of this two-part review, the primary determinants of image contrast, including T1, T2, and T2*, were highlighted. The development of pulse sequences designed to optimize each of these image contrasts was discussed and the impact of technological innovation (parallel imaging and high-field systems) on the manner in which these sequences could be modified to improve clinical efficacy was further emphasized. The scope of that discussion was broadened to include the application of: 1) water diffusion imaging used primarily for detection of pathologies that restrict the free movement of water in the tissues and for defining fiber tracts in the brain; 2) the intravenous administration of exogenous contrast agents (gadolinium-diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid [GdDTPA]) for assessment of blood-brain-barrier (BBB) defects and brain blood flow; and 3) MR spectroscopy (MRS) for assessment of brain metabolites. The goal of this part is to discuss how these acquisitions are combined into specific protocols that can effectively detect and characterize, or in keeping with our artistic analogy, "paint" each of the major diseases affecting the central nervous system (CNS). This work concludes with a discussion of image artifacts and pitfalls in image interpretation, which, in spite our best efforts to minimize or eliminate them, continue to occur. Much of the ensuing discussion is based on our own institutional experience. Protocols, therefore, do not necessarily match those from other institutions due to variability in clinical emphasis, MR instruments, and available software. An attempt was made to focus on basic clinical sequences that are available on most modern MR systems, with protocols employing generally accepted clinical imaging philosophies.},

This connection is explored and interpreted with the help of a certain zerocrossing spectral representation, and is then ap plied in spectral analysis, detection, and discrimination. crossing counts in filtered time Zero- series are called higher order cross- ings. The theme of this work is that higher order crossings analysis provides a useful descriptive as well as an analytical tool that can in many respects match spectral analysis. To a great extent these two types of analysis are, in fact, equivalent, but each emphasizes a different point of view. Advantages offered by higher order crossings are great simplicity and a drastic data reduction.},

The assay detects seven major cellular components. In a pilot screen of bioactive compounds, the assay detected a range of cellular phenotypes and it clustered compounds with similar annotated protein targets or chemical structure based on cytological profiles. The results demonstrate that the assay captures subtle patterns in the combination of morphological labels, thereby detecting the effects of chemical compounds even though their targets are not stained directly.

abstract = {White matter (WM) lesions are thought to play an important role in multiple sclerosis (MS) disease burden. Recent work in the automated segmentation of white matter lesions from magnetic resonance imaging has utilized a model in which lesions are outliers in the distribution of tissue signal intensities across the entire brain of each patient. However, the sensitivity and specificity of lesion detection and segmentation with these approaches have been inadequate. In our analysis, we determined this is due to the substantial overlap between the whole brain signal intensity distribution of lesions and normal tissue. Inspired by the ability of experts to detect lesions based on their local signal intensity characteristics, we propose a new algorithm that achieves lesion and brain tissue segmentation through simultaneous estimation of a spatially global within-the-subject intensity distribution and a spatially local intensity distribution derived from a healthy reference population. We demonstrate that MS lesions can be segmented as outliers from this intensity model of population and subject. We carried out extensive experiments with both synthetic and clinical data, and compared the performance of our new algorithm to those of state-of-the art techniques. We found this new approach leads to a substantial improvement in the sensitivity and specificity of lesion detection and segmentation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent postmortem studies in MS brain suggest that the severity of changes in DAWM can be measured by using quantitative MR imaging. This study aimed to characterize DAWM in vivo by using 4 quantitative MR imaging measures and to explore differences between MS disease types. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 17 patients with chronic MS (7 PP, 10 SP), quantitative MR imaging was performed at 1.5T, yielding whole-brain voxelwise maps of T1, MTR, ADC, and FA. ROIs were placed to obtain values for DAWM, NAWM, and WM lesions. A general linear mixed-model analysis was used to compare T1, MTR, ADC, and FA between tissue types and disease types. RESULTS: Values of T1, MTR, ADC, and FA for DAWM were intermediate to those observed in NAWM and WM lesions. In patients with SPMS, DAWM was significantly different from both WM lesions and NAWM regarding all 4 measures, while in patients with PPMS, DAWM differed significantly from NAWM regarding T1, MTR, and FA and from lesions only regarding FA. Most interesting, DAWM differed between disease types: DAWM in patients with SPMS exhibited significantly higher T1 and lower MTR than did DAWM in patients with PPMS. CONCLUSIONS: In vivo T1, MTR, ADC, and FA reflect the variable severity of pathologic changes in DAWM in MS. Moreover, these quantitative MR imaging measures suggest that DAWM may differ between PPMS and SPMS.},

abstract = {A novel procedure is proposed to extract T1, T2, and relative spin density from the signal time course sampled with a series of TrueFISP images after spin inversion. Generally, the recovery of the magnetization during continuous TrueFISP imaging can be described in good approximation by a three parameter monoexponential function S(t) = S stst(1-INV exp(-t/T1*). This apparent relaxation time T1* ≤ T1 depends on the flip angle as well as on both T1 and T2. Here, it is shown that the ratio T1/T2 can be directly extracted from the inversion factor INV, which describes the relation of the signal value extrapolated to t = 0 and the steady-state signal. Analytical expressions are given for the derivation of T1, T2, and relative spin density directly from the fit parameters. Phantom results show excellent agreement with single point reference measurements. In human volunteers T1, T2, and spin density maps in agreement with literature values were obtained. {\textcopyright} 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {An artifact found in magnetic resonance images (MRI) called partial volume averaging (PVA) has received much attention since accurate segmentation of cerebral anatomy and pathology is impeded by this artifact. Traditional neurological segmentation techniques rely on Gaussian mixture models to handle noise and PVA, or high-dimensional feature sets that exploit redundancy in multispectral datasets. Unfortunately, model-based techniques may not be optimal for images with non-Gaussian noise distributions and/or pathology, and multispectral techniques model probabilities instead of the partial volume (PV) fraction. For robust segmentation, a PV fraction estimation approach is developed for cerebral MRI that does not depend on predetermined intensity distribution models or multispectral scans. Instead, the PV fraction is estimated directly from each image using an adaptively defined global edge map constructed by exploiting a relationship between edge content and PVA. The final PVA map is used to segment anatomy and pathology with subvoxel accuracy. Validation on simulated and real, pathology-free T1 MRI (Gaussian noise), as well as pathological fluid attenuation inversion recovery MRI (non-Gaussian noise), demonstrate that the PV fraction is accurately estimated and the resultant segmentation is robust. Comparison to model-based methods further highlight the benefits of the current approach.},

abstract = {OBJECT: Catheter-based evacuation is a novel surgical approach for the treatment of brain hemorrhage. The object of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ultrasound in combination with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) delivered through a microcatheter directly into spontaneous intraventricular (IVH) or intracerebral (ICH) hemorrhage in humans. METHODS: Thirty-three patients presenting to the Swedish Medical Center in Seattle, Washington, with ICH and IVH were screened between November 21, 2008, and July 13, 2009, for entry into this study. Entry criteria included the spontaneous onset of intracranial hemorrhage {\textgreater}/= 25 ml and/or IVH producing ventricular obstruction. Nine patients (6 males and 3 females, with an average age of 63 years [range 38-83 years]) who met the entry criteria consented to participate and were entered into the trial. A ventricular drainage catheter and an ultrasound microcatheter were stereotactically delivered together, directly into the IVH or ICH. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and 24 hours of continuous ultrasound were delivered to the clot. Gravity drainage was performed. In patients with IVHs, 3 mg of rt-PA was injected; in patients with intraparenchymal hemorrhages, 0.9 mg of rt-PA was injected. The rt-PA was delivered in 3 doses over 24 hours. RESULTS: All patients had significant volume reductions in the treated hemorrhage. The mean percentage volume reduction after 24 hours of therapy, as determined on CT and compared with pretreatment stability scans, was 59 +/- 5{\%} (mean +/- SEM) for ICH and 45.1 +/- 13{\%} for IVH (1 patient with ICH was excluded from analysis because of catheter breakage). There were no intracranial infections and no significant episodes of rebleeding according to clinical or CT assessment. One death occurred by 30 days after admission. Clinical improvements as determined by a decrease in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score were demonstrated at 30 days after treatment in 7 of 9 patients. The rate of hemorrhage lysis was compared between 8 patients who completed treatment, and patient cohorts treated for IVH and ICH using identical doses of rt-PA and catheter drainage but without the ultrasound (courtesy of the MISTIE [Minimally Invasive Surgery plus T-PA for Intracerebral Hemorrhage Evacuation] and CLEAR II [Clot Lysis Evaluating Accelerated Resolution of Intraventricular Hemorrhage II] studies). Compared with the MISTIE and CLEAR data, the authors observed a faster rate of lysis during treatment for IVH and ICH in the patients treated with sonolysis plus rt-PA versus rt-PA alone. CONCLUSIONS: Lysis and drainage of spontaneous ICH and IVH with a reduction in mass effect can be accomplished rapidly and safely through sonothrombolysis using stereotactically delivered drainage and ultrasound catheters via a bur hole. A larger clinical trial with catheters specifically designed for brain blood clot removal is warranted.},

abstract = {Fitting regression models can be challenging when regression coefficients are high-dimensional. Especially when large spatial or temporal effects need to be taken into account the limits of computational capacities of normal working stations are reached quickly. The analysis of images with several million pixels, where each pixel value can be seen as an observation on a new spatial location, represent such a situation. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework for the applied statistician is presented that allows to fit models with millions of parameters with only low to moderate computational requirements. The method combines a modified sampling scheme with novel accomplishments in iterative methods for sparse linear systems. This way a solution is given that eliminates potential computational burdens such as calculating the log-determinant of massive precision matrices and sampling from high-dimensional Gaussian distributions. In an extensive simulation study with models of moderate size it is shown that this approach gives results that are in perfect agreement with state-of-the-art methods for fitting structured additive regression models. Furthermore, the method is applied to two real world examples from the field of medical imaging.},

abstract = {Graph Cuts have been shown as a powerful interactive segmentation technique in several medical domains. We propose to automate the Graph Cuts in order to automatically segment Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesions in MRI. We replace the manual interaction with a robust EM-based approach in order to discriminate between MS lesions and the Normal Appearing Brain Tissues (NABT). Evaluation is performed in synthetic and real images showing good agreement between the automatic segmentation and the target segmentation. We compare our algorithm with the state of the art techniques and with several manual segmentations. An advantage of our algorithm over previously published ones is the possibility to semi-automatically improve the segmentation due to the Graph Cuts interactive feature.},

abstract = {Parallel imaging is a robust method for accelerating the acquisition of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, and has made possible many new applications of MR imaging. Parallel imaging works by acquiring a reduced amount of k-space data with an array of receiver coils. These undersampled data can be acquired more quickly, but the undersampling leads to aliased images. One of several parallel imaging algorithms can then be used to reconstruct artifact-free images from either the aliased images (SENSE-type reconstruction) or from the undersampled data (GRAPPA-type reconstruction). The advantages of parallel imaging in a clinical setting include faster image acquisition, which can be used, for instance, to shorten breath-hold times resulting in fewer motion-corrupted examinations. In this article the basic concepts behind parallel imaging are introduced. The relationship between undersampling and aliasing is discussed and two commonly used parallel imaging methods, SENSE and GRAPPA, are explained in detail. Examples of artifacts arising from parallel imaging are shown and ways to detect and mitigate these artifacts are described. Finally, several current applications of parallel imaging are presented and recent advancements and promising research in parallel imaging are briefly reviewed.},
