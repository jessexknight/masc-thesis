\chapter{Implementation}
Speed of model fitting is a significant factor during development, particularly considering optimization of so-called hyperparameters. Faster training yields more model iterations, which inevitably bear improvements. Several implementation

\section{Overview}
For reference, we summarize the details of the workstation doing most processing:
\begin{itemize}
  \item MATLAB R2011a
  \item Windows 10

\section{Parallel Fitting}
In order to efficiently estimate the logistic regression parameters for all voxels -- which are modelled independently -- it is helpful to compute these in parallel.

The first step in such optimization schemes is to scale the feature data by the classification labels $\C$,
\begin{equation}
  \Y_{\C=1} \leftarrow -\Y_{\C=1}.
\end{equation}

The computations of the update include
