  title = {{mixup: Beyond Empirical Risk Minimization}},
  year = {2017},
  abstract = {Large deep neural networks are powerful, but exhibit undesirable behaviors such as memorization and sensitivity to adversarial examples. In this work, we propose mixup, a simple learning principle to alleviate these issues. In essence, mixup trains a neural network on convex combinations of pairs of examples and their labels. By doing so, mixup regularizes the neural network to favor simple linear behavior in-between training examples. Our experiments on the ImageNet-2012, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Google commands and UCI datasets show that mixup improves the generalization of state-of-the-art neural network architectures. We also find that mixup reduces the memorization of corrupt labels, increases the robustness to adversarial examples, and stabilizes the training of generative adversarial networks.},

  abstract = {—Big data applications are typically associated with systems involving large numbers of users, massive complex software systems, and large-scale heterogeneous computing and storage architectures. The construction of such systems involves many distributed design choices. The end products (e.g., rec-ommendation systems, medical analysis tools, real-time game engines, speech recognizers) thus involves many tunable config-uration parameters. These parameters are often specified and hard-coded into the software by various developers or teams. If optimized jointly, these parameters can result in significant improvements. Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for the joint optimization of design choices that is gaining great popularity in recent years. It promises greater automation so as to increase both product quality and human productivity. This review paper introduces Bayesian optimization, highlights some of its methodological aspects, and showcases a wide range of applications.},

  abstract = {For an artificial agent to be considered truly intelligent it needs to excel at a variety of tasks considered challenging for humans. To date, it has only been possible to create individual algorithms able to master a single discipline for example, IBM's Deep Blue beat the human world champion at chess but was not able to do anything else. Now a team working at Google's DeepMind subsidiary has developed an artificial agent dubbed a deep Q-network that learns to play 49 classic Atari 2600 'arcade' games directly from sensory experience, achieving performance on a par with that of an expert human player. By combining reinforcement learning (selecting actions that maximize reward in this case the game score) with deep learning (multilayered feature extraction from high-dimensional data in this case the pixels), the game-playing agent takes artificial intelligence a step nearer the goal of systems capable of learning a diversity of challenging tasks from scratch.},

As a result of the weight adjustments, internal 'hidden' units wich are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units. The ability to create useful new features distinguishes back-propagation from earlier, simpoler methods such as the perceptron-convergence procedure.},

Disease mechanisms can be investigated in preclinical models and patients with multiple sclerosis by molecular and metabolic imaging techniques. Many insights have been gained from such imaging studies: persisting inflammation in the absence of a damaged blood-brain barrier, activated microglia within and beyond lesions, increased mitochondrial activity after acute lesions, raised sodium concentrations in the brain, increased glutamate in acute lesions and normal-appearing white matter, different degrees of demyelination in different patients and lesions, early neuronal damage in grey matter, and early astrocytic proliferation and activation in lesions and white matter. Clinical translation of molecular and metabolic imaging and extension of these techniques will enable the assessment of novel drugs targeted at these disease mechanisms, and have the potential to improve health outcomes through the stratification of patients for treatments.},

Whole-head synthetic image phantoms with manually introduced leukoaraiosis lesions of varying severity were constructed. These synthetic image phantom sets incorporated image contrast and anatomic features that mimicked leukoaraiosis found in real life. One set of synthetic image phantoms was used to develop the segmentation algorithm (FLAIR-histoseg). A second set was used to measure its accuracy. Test retest reproducibility was assessed in 10 elderly volunteers who were imaged twice. The mean absolute error of the FLAIR-histoseg method was 6.6{\%} for measurement of leukoaraiosis volume and 1.4{\%} for brain volume. The mean test retest coefficient of variation was 1.4{\%} for leukoaraiosis volume and 0.3{\%} for brain volume. We conclude that the FLAIR-histoseg method is an accurate and reproducible method for measuring leukoaraiosis and whole-brain volume in elderly subjects.},

As each patient is unique, an unbiased and biologically plausible model of pathological data would have to be able to adapt to the subject's individual presentation. Such a model would provide the means for a better understanding of the underlying biological processes and improve one's ability to define pathologically meaningful imaging biomarkers. With this aim in mind, this work proposes a hierarchical fully unsupervised model selection framework for neuroimaging data which enables the distinction between different types of abnormal image patterns without pathological a priori knowledge. Its application on simulated and clinical data demonstrated the ability to detect abnormal intensity clusters, resulting in a competitive to improved behavior in white matter lesion segmentation when compared to three other freely-available automated methods.},

We investigated whether the use of fFLAIR also increases the sensitivity of brain MRI assessment in patients with systemic autoimmune disorders. Turbo spin echo (TSE) dual-echo and fFLAIR scans of the brain were obtained from patients affected by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with (NSLE, n = 9) and without clinical CNS involvement (n = 15), Beh{\c{c}}et disease (n = 5), Wegener granulomatosis (n = 9), and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (n = 6). Brain hyperintense lesions were counted and classified according to their size and their location by two observers by consensual agreement. The total lesion volume was measured using a semiautomated technique for lesion segmentation on both TSE and fFLAIR scans. The imaging modalities showed brain hyperintense lesions in all 9 SLE patients with CNS involvement, 5 of 15 SLE patients without CNS involvement, 5 of 9 patients with Wegener granulomatosis, 1 of 5 with Beh{\c{c}}et disease, and 3 of 6 with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. A total of 342 lesions were seen on both sequences; 88 were seen only on TSE and 54 only on fFLAIR scans. The average number of brain lesions per scan was higher on TSE than on fFLAIR, since significantly more discrete (P{\textless}0.002) and small (P = 0.004) lesions were seen on TSE than on fFLAIR. The median total lesion volume, however, was similar on TSE and fFLAIR. Our study indicates that the use of fFLAIR does not improve the sensitivity of fast dual-echo MRI for detecting brain abnormalities in patients with systemic autoimmune disorders.},

We prove convergence to a minimizer for dimension 1, and various limited convergence results for dimension 2. A counterexample of McKinnon gives a family of strictly convex functions in two dimensions and a set of initial conditions for which the Nelder-Mead algorithm converges to a nonminimizer. It is not yet known whether the Nelder-Mead method can be proved to converge to a minimizer for a more specialized class of convex functions in two dimensions.},

Background: The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence fast FLAIR (fluid attenuated inversion recovery) has demonstrated overall increased lesion detection when compared to conventional or fast spin echo (FSE) but fewer lesions in the posterior fossa and spinal cord. The reasons for this are unknown, but may be due to variations in the T1 and T2 relaxation times within NAWM and MS lesions. Method: Ten patients and 10 controls underwent MRI of the brain which involved FSE, fast FLAIR and the measurement of T1 and T2 relaxation times. Results: Of 151 lesions analysed (22 infra-tentorial, 129 supra-tentorial), eight were missed by the fast FLAIR sequence. T1 and T2 relaxation times in normal controls were longer in the infra-tentorial, than supra-tentorial, region. Patient NAWM relaxation times were prolonged compared with control values in both regions. Lesions demonstrated longer relaxation times than either control white matter or patient NAWM in both regions, however this difference was less marked infra-tentorially. The eight posterior fossa lesions not visible on the fast FLAIR sequence were characterised by short T1 and T2 relaxation times which overlapped with the patient NAWM for both T1 and T2 and with control values for T2 relaxation times. Conclusion: Both lesion and NAWM relaxation time characteristics vary throughout the brain. The TI and T2 relaxation times of infra-tentorial lesions are closer to the relaxation times of local NAWM than supra-tentorial lesions, resulting in reduced contrast between posterior fossa lesions and the background NAWM. Consequently the characteristics of some lesions overlap with those of NAWM resulting in reduced conspicuity. By utilising this information, it may be possible to optimise fast FLAIR sequences to improve infra-tentorial lesion detection. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a common accompaniment of ageing. Features seen on neuroimaging include recent small subcortical infarcts, lacunes, white matter hyperintensities, perivascular spaces, microbleeds, and brain atrophy. SVD can present as a stroke or cognitive decline, or can have few or no symptoms. SVD frequently coexists with neurodegenerative disease, and can exacerbate cognitive deficits, physical disabilities, and other symptoms of neurodegeneration. Terminology and definitions for imaging the features of SVD vary widely, which is also true for protocols for image acquisition and image analysis. This lack of consistency hampers progress in identifying the contribution of SVD to the pathophysiology and clinical features of common neurodegenerative diseases. We are an international working group from the Centres of Excellence in Neurodegeneration. We completed a structured process to develop definitions and imaging standards for markers and consequences of SVD. We aimed to achieve the following: first, to provide a common advisory about terms and definitions for features visible on MRI; second, to suggest minimum standards for image acquisition and analysis; third, to agree on standards for scientific reporting of changes related to SVD on neuroimaging; and fourth, to review emerging imaging methods for detection and quantification of preclinical manifestations of SVD. Our findings and recommendations apply to research studies, and can be used in the clinical setting to standardise image interpretation, acquisition, and reporting. This Position Paper summarises the main outcomes of this international effort to provide the STandards for ReportIng Vascular changes on nEuroimaging (STRIVE). {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Firstly, a generative approach based on an Expectation-Maximization framework that incorporates a glioma growth model is used to segment the brain scans into tumor, as well as healthy tissue labels. Secondly, a gradient boosting multi-class classification scheme is used to refine tumor labels based on information from multiple patients. Lastly, a probabilistic Bayesian strategy is employed to further refine and finalize the tumor segmentation based on patient-specific intensity statistics from the multiple modalities. We evaluated our approach in 186 cases during the training phase of the BRAin Tumor Segmentation (BRATS) 2015 challenge and report promising results. During the testing phase, the algorithm was additionally evaluated in 53 unseen cases, achieving the best performance among the competing methods.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel segmentation approach based on deep 3D convolutional encoder networks with shortcut connections and apply it to the segmentation of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions in magnetic resonance images. Our model is a neural network that consists of two interconnected pathways, a convolutional pathway, which learns increasingly more abstract and higher-level image features, and a deconvolutional pathway, which predicts the final segmentation at the voxel level. The joint training of the feature extraction and prediction pathways allows for the automatic learning of features at different scales that are optimized for accuracy for any given combination of image types and segmentation task. In addition, shortcut connections between the two pathways allow high- and low-level features to be integrated, which enables the segmentation of lesions across a wide range of sizes. We have evaluated our method on two publicly available data sets (MICCAI 2008 and ISBI 2015 challenges) with the results showing that our method performs comparably to the top-ranked state-of-the-art methods, even when only relatively small data sets are available for training. In addition, we have evaluated our method on a large data set from an MS clinical trial, with a comparison of network architectures of different depths and with and without shortcut connections. The results show that increasing depth from three to seven layers improves performance, and adding shortcut connections further increases accuracy. For a direct comparison, we also ran the same data set through five freely available and widely used MS lesion segmentation methods, namely EMS, LST-LPA, LST-LGA, Lesion-TOADS, and SLS. The results show that our method consistently outperforms these other methods across a wide range of lesion sizes.},

In the present study, an optimized artificial neural network was used as an automatic segmentation method to produce probabilistic maps of WMC in a clinical multi-center study. The neural network uses information from T1- and T2-weighted and fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance (MR) scans, neighboring voxels and spatial location. Generalizability of the neural network was optimized by including the Optimal Brain Damage (OBD) pruning method in the training stage. Six optimized neural networks were produced to investigate the impact of different input information on WMC segmentation. The automatic segmentation method was applied to MR scans of 362 non-demented elderly subjects from 11 centers in the European multi-center study Leukoaraiosis And Disability (LADIS). Semi-manually delineated WMC were used for validating the segmentation produced by the neural networks. The neural network segmentation demonstrated high consistency between subjects and centers, making it a promising technique for large studies. For WMC volumes less than 10 ml, an increasing discrepancy between semi-manual and neural network segmentation was observed using the similarity index (SI) measure. The use of all three image modalities significantly improved cross-center generalizability compared to neural networks using the FLAIR image only. Expert knowledge not available to the neural networks was a minor source of discrepancy, while variation in MR scan quality constituted the largest source of error.},

  abstract = {Atlas-based segmentation techniques are often employed to encode anatomical information for the delineation of multiple structures in magnetic resonance images of the brain. One of the primary challenges of these approaches is to efficiently model qualitative and quantitative anatomical knowledge without introducing a strong bias toward certain anatomical preferences when segmenting new images. This paper explores the use of topological information as a prior and proposes a segmentation framework based on both topological and statistical atlases of brain anatomy. Topology can be used to describe continuity of structures, as well as the relationships between structures, and is often a critical component in cortical surface reconstruction and deformation-based morphometry. Our method guarantees strict topological equivalence between the segmented image and the atlas, and relies only weakly on a statistical atlas of shape. Tissue classification and fast marching methods are used to provide a powerful and flexible framework to handle multiple image contrasts, high levels of noise, gain field inhomogeneities, and variable anatomies. The segmentation algorithm has been validated on simulated and real brain image data and made freely available to researchers. Our experiments demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the method and the limited influence of the statistical atlas. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

By using the context of a voxel to be classified and its transformation to an overcomplete set of Haar-like features, it is possible to capture class specific characteristics despite the well-known drawbacks of MR imaging. By successively selecting and combining the most discriminative features during ensemble boosting within a tree structure, the overall procedure is able to learn a discriminative model for voxel classification in terms of posterior probabilities. The final segmentation is obtained after refining the preliminary result by stochastic relaxation and a standard level set approach. A quantitative evaluation within a leave-one-out validation shows the applicability of the proposed method.},

  abstract      = {Quantitative analysis has tremendous but mostly unrealized potential in healthcare to support objective and accurate interpretation of the clinical imaging. In 2008, the National Cancer Institute began building the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) initiative with the goal of advancing quantitative imaging in the context of personalized therapy and evaluation of treatment response. Computerized analysis is an important component contributing to reproducibility and efficiency of the quantitative imaging techniques. The success of quantitative imaging is contingent on robust analysis methods and software tools to bring these methods from bench to bedside.3D Slicer is a free open-source software application for medical image computing. As a clinical research tool, 3D Slicer is similar to a radiology workstation that supports versatile visualizations but also provides advanced functionality such as automated segmentation and registration for a variety of application domains. Unlike a typical radiology workstation, 3D Slicer is free and is not tied to specific hardware. As a programming platform, 3D Slicer facilitates translation and evaluation of the new quantitative methods by allowing the biomedical researcher to focus on the implementation of the algorithm and providing abstractions for the common tasks of data communication, visualization and user interface development. Compared to other tools that provide aspects of this functionality, 3D Slicer is fully open source and can be readily extended and redistributed. In addition, 3D Slicer is designed to facilitate the development of new functionality in the form of 3D Slicer extensions. In this paper, we present an overview of 3D Slicer as a platform for prototyping, development and evaluation of image analysis tools for clinical research applications. To illustrate the utility of the platform in the scope of QIN, we discuss several use cases of 3D Slicer by the existing QIN teams, and we elaborate on the future directions that can further facilitate development and validation of imaging biomarkers using 3D Slicer. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract  = {The remarkable success of magnetic resonance imaging of adult brain relates to the unusually large ratio of the longitudinal relaxation rates 1/T1 of white and gray matter, approximately 2:1 at physiological temperature and traditional imaging fields. Several investigators have conjectured that myelin is the source of the greater 1/T1 of white matter without, however, suggesting details of the molecular mechanisms responsible. From measurements of the magnetic field dependence of 1/T1 (NMRD profiles) of adult and neonatal gray and white matter at 5 and 35 degrees C, we find a thermally activated contribution to the NMRD profile of adult white matter that is not present in the profiles of either adult gray or neonatal gray and white matter. We attribute this contribution to myelin and develop a quantitative model that accounts for the unique relaxation behavior of myelinated white matter. We find that myelin water, 15{\%} of the total, has a relatively short T1 that arises from an unexpectedly large interaction with myelin lipid; when cast in terms of an interaction over the entire myelin bilipid-water interface, it is sevenfold greater than the analogous protein-water interfacial interaction. Its magnitude remains to be accounted for, but cholesterol, known to alter the relaxation rates of lipid protons, may play an important role. The contribution of myelin to 1/T1 at physiological temperatures is attributed to thermally activated transmembrane diffusion of water and, hence, more rapid mixing of axonal and the rapidly relaxing myelin water molecules.},

Spatial variability in intensities of multimodal MR images over the brain is explicitly modeled by building region-specific multivariate likelihood distributions. Local smoothness is ensured by incorporating neighboring voxel tissue information using Markov Random fields. A probabilistic measure of confidence for the classification is then presented, which can also be used to assess disease burden. The method was tested on 10 patients with MS by comparing automatically classified lesions, with and without regional information, to manual classifications by five expert raters using volume count and overlap. Results improve with the incorporation of spatial information, and are comparable to manual classifications. This method also enables a more accurate classification in the posterior fossa, where no other method reports success.},

A patch database is built using training images for which the label maps are known. For each patch in the testing image, k similar patches are retrieved from the database. The matching labels for these k patches are then combined to produce an initial segmentation map for the test case. Finally an iterative patch-based label refinement process based on the initial segmentation map is performed to ensure the spatial consistency of the detected lesions. The method was evaluated in experiments on multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation in magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain. An evaluation was done for each image in the MICCAI 2008 MS lesion segmentation challenge. Results are shown to compete with the state of the art in the challenge. We conclude that the proposed algorithm for segmentation of lesions provides a promising new approach for local segmentation and global detection in medical images.},

  abstract = {It has been reported that the severity of subcortical vascular dementia (VaD) correlated with an area ratio of white matter hyperintensity (WMH) regions to the brain parenchyma (WMH area ratio). The purpose of this study was to develop a computer-aided evaluation method of WMH regions for diagnosis of subcortical VaD based on magnetic resonance (MR) images. A brain parenchymal region was segmented based on the histogram analysis of a T1-weigthed image. The WMH regions were segmented on the subtraction image between a T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) images using two segmentation methods, i.e., a region-growing technique and a level-set method, which were automatically and adaptively selected on each WMH region based on its image features by using a support vector machine. We applied the proposed method to 33 slices of the three types of MR images with 245 lesions, which were acquired from 10 patients (age range: 64-90 years, mean: 78) with a diagnosis of VaD on a 1.5-T MR imaging scanner. The average similarity index between regions determined by a manual method and the proposed method was 93.5 ?? 2.0{\%} for brain parenchymal regions and 78.2 ?? 11.0{\%} for WMH regions. The WMH area ratio obtained by the proposed method correlated with that determined by two neuroradiologists with a correlation coefficient of 0.992. The results presented in this study suggest that the proposed method could assist neuroradiologists in the evaluation of WMH regions related to the subcortical VaD. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

This requires the knowledge of the statistical intensity distribution of the background signal, that is, the probability density of the occurrence of a certain signal intensity. The influence of many new MRI techniques and, in particular, of various parallel-imaging methods on the noise statistics has neither been rigorously investigated nor experimentally demonstrated yet. In this study, the statistical distribution of background noise was analyzed for MR acquisitions with a single-channel and a 32-channel coil, with sum-of-squares (SoS) and spatial-matched-filter (SMF) data combination, with and without parallel imaging using k-space and image-domain algorithms, with real-part and conventional magnitude reconstruction and with several reconstruction filters. Depending on the imaging technique, the background noise could be described by a Rayleigh distribution, a noncentral chi-distribution or the positive half of a Gaussian distribution. In particular, the noise characteristics of SoS-reconstructed multichannel acquisitions (with k-space-based parallel imaging or without parallel imaging) differ substantially from those with image-domain parallel imaging or SMF combination. These effects must be taken into account if mean values or standard deviations of background noise are employed for data analysis such as determination of local noise levels. Assuming a Rayleigh distribution as in conventional MR images or a noncentral chi-distribution for all multichannel acquisitions is invalid in general and may lead to erroneous estimates of the signal-to-noise ratio or the contrast-to-noise ratio.},

  abstract = {A better understanding of the pathological mechanisms that drive neurodegeneration in individuals with multiple sclerosis is needed to develop therapies that will effectively treat patients in the primary and secondary progressive stages of the disease. We propose that the inflammatory demyelinating disease process in early multiple sclerosis triggers a cascade of events that lead to neurodegeneration and are amplified by pathogenic mechanisms related to brain ageing and accumulated disease burden. Key elements driving neurodegeneration include microglia activation, chronic oxidative injury, accumulation of mitochondrial damage in axons, and age-related iron accumulation in the human brain. Altered mitochondrial function in axons might be of particular importance. This process leads to chronic cell stress and imbalance of ionic homoeostasis, resulting in axonal and neuronal death. The evidence suggests that treatment of progressive multiple sclerosis should be based on a combination of anti-inflammatory, regenerative, and neuroprotective strategies.},

  abstract  = {S troke is a leading cause of disability in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death. 1 An acute ischemic stroke (AIS) occurs when an artery supplying the brain becomes oc-cluded, leading to the death of brain tissue and focal neurological deficits. An estimated 700 000 ischemic strokes occur in the United States each year, costing more than {\$}70 billion to society. 1 The toll exerted on individual patients and families by a devastating stroke is incalculable; most elderly patients fear a disabling stroke more than they fear death. 2 Thus, improving neurological outcome after an is-chemic stroke is a major societal priority and has attracted intense attention of clinical and basic researchers, government funding agen-cies, and industry. Consistent with animal models of ischemia, the overarching goal of AIS therapy is relieving the arterial occlusion (recanalization) and restoring cerebral blood flow (reperfusion) as soon as possible to reduce tissue injury and improve outcomes. There is general consensus based on strong evidence that in pa-tients presenting within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV rtPA) therapy is ben-eficial. However, many patients present with occlusion of a large proximal artery beyond 4.5 hours or have contraindications to sys-temic thrombolysis (ie, recent major surgery or active bleeding). For these reasons and because proximal artery occlusions are rela-tively resistant to intravenous thrombolysis, catheter-based or intra-arterial approaches to directly remove the clot and restore blood flow to the brain have been the focus of recent randomized clinical trials. We review acute stroke treatment with an emphasis on intra-IMPORTANCE Acute ischemic stroke is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States. We review the latest data and evidence supporting catheter-directed treatment for proximal artery occlusion as an adjunct to intravenous thrombolysis in patients with acute stroke. OBJECTIVE To review the pathophysiology of acute brain ischemia and infarction and the evidence supporting various stroke reperfusion treatments. EVIDENCE REVIEW Systematic literature search of MEDLINE databases published between January 1, 1990, and February 11, 2015, was performed to identify studies addressing the role of thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy in acute stroke management. Studies included randomized clinical trials, observational studies, guideline statements, and review articles. Sixty-eight articles (N = 108 082 patients) were selected for review. FINDINGS Intravenous thrombolysis is the mainstay of acute ischemic stroke management for any patient with disabling deficits presenting within 4.5 hours from symptom onset. Randomized trials have demonstrated that more patients return to having good function (defined by being independent and having slight disability or less) when treated within 4.5 hours after symptom onset with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV rtPA) therapy. Mechanical thrombectomy in select patients with acute ischemic stroke and proximal artery occlusions has demonstrated substantial rates of partial or complete arterial recanalization and improved outcomes compared with IV rtPA or best medical treatment alone in multiple randomized clinical trials. Regardless of mode of reperfusion, earlier reperfusion is associated with better clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Intravenous rtPA remains the standard of care for patients with moderate to severe neurological deficits who present within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. Outcomes for some patients with acute ischemic stroke and moderate to severe neurological deficits due to proximal artery occlusion are improved with endovascular reperfusion therapy. Efforts to hasten reperfusion therapy, regardless of the mode, should be undertaken within organized stroke systems of care. Systematic literature search of MEDLINE databases published be-tween January 1, 1990, and February 11, 2015, was performed to iden-tify studies addressing the role of thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy in acute stroke management. We searched Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms in multiple combinations includ-ing brain ischemia/drug therapy, stroke drug/therapy, tissue plas-minogen activator, fibrinolytic agents, endovascular procedures, thrombectomy, time factors, emergency service, treatment out-come, multicenter study, and randomized controlled trial. Studies re-porting outcomes from acute thrombolysis and mechanical throm-bectomy were included for review. The search was limited to human studies without language restrictions applied. This search was supple-mented by reviewing additional references from included studies. Sixty-eight articles (N = 108 082 patients) were selected for re-view (eFigure in the Supplement). Background},

This connection is explored and interpreted with the help of a certain zerocrossing spectral representation, and is then ap plied in spectral analysis, detection, and discrimination. crossing counts in filtered time Zero- series are called higher order cross- ings. The theme of this work is that higher order crossings analysis provides a useful descriptive as well as an analytical tool that can in many respects match spectral analysis. To a great extent these two types of analysis are, in fact, equivalent, but each emphasizes a different point of view.

  abstract = {The location and extent of white matter lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are important criteria for diagnosis, follow-up and prognosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Clinical trials have shown that quantitative values, such as lesion volumes, are meaningful in MS prognosis. Manual lesion delineation for the segmentation of lesions is, however, time-consuming and suffers from observer variability. In this paper, we propose MSmetrix, an accurate and reliable automatic method for lesion segmentation based on MRI, independent of scanner or acquisition protocol and without requiring any training data. In MSmetrix, 3D T1-weighted and FLAIR MR images are used in a probabilistic model to detect white matter (WM) lesions as an outlier to normal brain while segmenting the brain tissue into grey matter, WM and cerebrospinal fluid. The actual lesion segmentation is performed based on prior knowledge about the location (within WM) and the appearance (hyperintense on FLAIR) of lesions. The accuracy of MSmetrix is evaluated by comparing its output with expert reference segmentations of 20 MRI datasets of MS patients. Spatial overlap (Dice) between the MSmetrix and the expert lesion segmentation is 0.67 ± 0.11. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) equals 0.8 indicating a good volumetric agreement between the MSmetrix and expert labelling. The reproducibility of MSmetrix' lesion volumes is evaluated based on 10 MS patients, scanned twice with a short interval on three different scanners. The agreement between the first and the second scan on each scanner is evaluated through the spatial overlap and absolute lesion volume difference between them. The spatial overlap was 0.69 ± 0.14 and absolute total lesion volume difference between the two scans was 0.54 ± 0.58 ml. Finally, the accuracy and reproducibility of MSmetrix compare favourably with other publicly available MS lesion segmentation algorithms, applied on the same data using default parameter settings.},

Manual delineation of MS lesions is a time-consuming task, requiring neuroradiology experts to analyze huge volume of MR data. This, in addition to the high intra- and inter-observer variability necessitates the requirement of automated MS lesion classification methods. Among many image representation models and classification methods that can be used for such purpose, we investigate the use of sparse modeling. In the recent years, sparse representation has evolved as a tool in modeling data using a few basis elements of an over-complete dictionary and has found applications in many image processing tasks including classification. We propose a supervised classification approach by learning dictionaries specific to the lesions and individual healthy brain tissues, which include white matter (WM), gray matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The size of the dictionaries learned for each class plays a major role in data representation but it is an even more crucial element in the case of competitive classification. Our approach adapts the size of the dictionary for each class, depending on the complexity of the underlying data. The algorithm is validated using 52 multi-sequence MR images acquired from 13 MS patients. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in MS lesion classification.},

Materials and methods.: Proton density-, T2- and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted brain images of 12 MR scans were pre-processed through intracranial cavity (IC) extraction, inhomogeneity correction and intensity normalization. Intensity-based statistical k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classification was combined with template-driven segmentation and partial volume artifact correction (TDS+) for segmentation of MS lesions subtypes and brain tissue compartments. Operator-supervised tissue sampling and parameter calibration were performed on 2 randomly selected scans and were applied automatically to the remaining 10 scans. Results from this three-channel TDS+ (3ch-TDS+) were compared to those from a previously validated two-channel TDS+ (2ch-TDS+) method. The results of both the 3ch-TDS+ and 2ch-TDS+ were also compared to manual segmentation performed by experts. Results.: Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) of 3ch-TDS+ for all three subtypes of lesions were higher (ICC between 0.95 and 0.96) than that of 2ch-TDS+ for T2 lesions (ICC??=??0.82). The 3ch-TDS+ also identified the three lesion subtypes with high specificity (98.7-99.9{\%}) and accuracy (98.5-99.9{\%}). Sensitivity of 3ch-TDS+ for T2 lesions was 16{\%} higher than with 2ch-TDS+. Enhancing lesions were segmented with the best sensitivity (81.9{\%}). "Black holes" were segmented with the least sensitivity (62.3{\%}). Conclusion.: 3ch-TDS+ is a promising method for automated segmentation of MS lesion subtypes. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {All fields of neuroscience that employ brain imaging need to communicate their results with reference to anatomical regions. In particular, comparative morphometry and group analysis of functional and physiological data require coregistration of brains to establish correspondences across brain structures. It is well established that linear registration of one brain to another is inadequate for aligning brain structures, so numerous algorithms have emerged to nonlinearly register brains to one another. This study is the largest evaluation of nonlinear deformation algorithms applied to brain image registration ever conducted. Fourteen algorithms from laboratories around the world are evaluated using 8 different error measures. More than 45,000 registrations between 80 manually labeled brains were performed by algorithms including: AIR, ANIMAL, ART, Diffeomorphic Demons, FNIRT, IRTK, JRD-fluid, ROMEO, SICLE, SyN, and four different SPM5 algorithms ("SPM2-type" and regular Normalization, Unified Segmentation, and the DARTEL Toolbox). All of these registrations were preceded by linear registration between the same image pairs using FLIRT. One of the most significant findings of this study is that the relative performances of the registration methods under comparison appear to be little affected by the choice of subject population, labeling protocol, and type of overlap measure. This is important because it suggests that the findings are generalizable to new subject populations that are labeled or evaluated using different labeling protocols. Furthermore, we ranked the 14 methods according to three completely independent analyses (permutation tests, one-way ANOVA tests, and indifference-zone ranking) and derived three almost identical top rankings of the methods. ART, SyN, IRTK, and SPM's DARTEL Toolbox gave the best results according to overlap and distance measures, with ART and SyN delivering the most consistently high accuracy across subjects and label sets. Updates will be published on the http://www.mindboggle.info/papers/ website.},

  abstract = {While computed tomography and other imaging techniques are measured in absolute units with physical meaning, magnetic resonance images are expressed in arbitrary units that are difficult to interpret and differ between study visits and subjects. Much work in the image processing literature on intensity normalization has focused on histogram matching and other histogram mapping techniques, with little emphasis on normalizing images to have biologically interpretable units. Furthermore, there are no formalized principles or goals for the crucial comparability of image intensities within and across subjects. To address this, we propose a set of criteria necessary for the normalization of images. We further propose simple and robust biologically motivated normalization techniques for multisequence brain imaging that have the same interpretation across acquisitions and satisfy the proposed criteria. We compare the performance of different normalization methods in thousands of images of patients with Alzheimer's disease, hundreds of patients with multiple sclerosis, and hundreds of healthy subjects obtained in several different studies at dozens of imaging centers. ?? 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract      = {One of the most challenging problems in modern neuroimaging is detailed characterization of neurodegeneration. Quantifying spatial and longitudinal atrophy patterns is an important component of this process. These spatiotemporal signals will aid in discriminating between related diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which manifest themselves in the same at-risk population. Here, we develop a novel symmetric image normalization method (SyN) for maximizing the cross-correlation within the space of diffeomorphic maps and provide the Euler-Lagrange equations necessary for this optimization. We then turn to a careful evaluation of our method. Our evaluation uses gold standard, human cortical segmentation to contrast SyN's performance with a related elastic method and with the standard ITK implementation of Thirion's Demons algorithm. The new method compares favorably with both approaches, in particular when the distance between the template brain and the target brain is large. We then report the correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic cortical labelings of FTD and control subjects with those gained by the manual rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods tested, SyN's volume measurements are the most strongly correlated with volume measurements gained by expert labeling. This study indicates that SyN, with cross-correlation, is a reliable method for normalizing and making anatomical measurements in volumetric MRI of patients and at-risk elderly individuals.},

  abstract = {Goal: In this paper, a fully automatic probabilistic method for multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion classification is presented, whereby the posterior probability density function over healthy tissues and two types of lesions (T1-hypointense and T2-hyperintense) is generated at every voxel. Methods: During training, the system explicitly models the spatial variability of the intensity distributions throughout the brain by first segmenting it into distinct anatomical regions and then building regional likelihood distributions for each tissue class based on multimodal magnetic resonance image (MRI) intensities. Local class smoothness is ensured by incorporating neighboring voxel information in the prior probability through Markov random fields. The system is tested on two datasets from real multisite clinical trials consisting of multimodal MRIs from a total of 100 patients with MS. Lesion classification results based on the framework are compared with and without the regional information, as well as with other state-of-The-Art methods against the labels from expert manual raters. The metrics for comparison include Dice overlap, sensitivity, and positive predictive rates for both voxel and lesion classifications. Results: Statistically significant improvements in Dice values ( p {\textless} 0.01), for voxel-based and lesion-based sensitivity values (p {\textless} 0.001), and positive predictive rates (p {\textless} 0.001 and p {\textless} 0.01 respectively) are shown when the proposed method is compared to the method without regional information, and to a widely used method [1]. This holds particularly true in the posterior fossa, an area where classification is very challenging. Significance: The proposed method allows us to provide clinicians with accurate tissue labels for T1-hypointense and T2-hyperintense lesions, two types of lesions that differ in appearance and clinical ramifications, and with a confidence level in the classification, which helps clinicians assess the classification results.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the precision and accuracy of an automated method for segmenting white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on fast fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) images in elderly brains at 3T. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FLAIR images from 18 individuals (60-82 years, 9 females) with WMH burdens ranging from 1-80 cm(3) were used. The protocol included the removal of clearly hyperintense voxels; two-class fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM); and thresholding to segment probable WMH. Two false-positive minimization (FPM) methods using white matter templates were tested. Precision was assessed by adding synthetic hyperintense voxels to brain slices. Accuracy was validated by comparing automatic and manual segmentations. Whole-brain, voxel-wise metrics of similarity, under- and overestimation were used to evaluate both precision and accuracy. RESULTS: Precision was high, as the lowest accuracy in the synthetic datasets was 93{\%}. Both FPM strategies successfully improved overall accuracy. Whole-brain accuracy for the FCM segmentation alone ranged from 45{\%}-81{\%}, which improved to 75{\%}-85{\%} using the FPM strategies. CONCLUSION: The method was accurate across the range of WMH burden typically seen in the elderly. Accuracy levels achieved or exceeded those of other approaches using multispectral and/or more sophisticated pattern recognition methods.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION$\backslash$nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become key in the diagnosis and disease monitoring of patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Both, T2 lesion load and Gadolinium (Gd) enhancing T1 lesions represent important endpoints in MS clinical trials by serving as a surrogate of clinical disease activity. T2- and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) lesion quantification - largely due to methodological constraints – is still being performed manually or in a semi-automated fashion, although strong efforts have been made to allow automated quantitative lesion segmentation. In 2012, Schmidt and co-workers published an algorithm to be applied on FLAIR sequences. The aim of this study was to apply the Schmidt algorithm on an independent data set and compare automated segmentation to inter-rater variability of three independent, experienced raters. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS$\backslash$nMRI data of 50 patients with RRMS were randomly selected from a larger pool of MS patients attending the MS Clinic at the Brain and Mind Centre, University of Sydney, Australia. MRIs were acquired on a 3.0T GE scanner (Discovery MR750, GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) using an 8 channel head coil. We determined T2-lesion load (total lesion volume and total lesion number) using three versions of an automated segmentation algorithm (Lesion growth algorithm (LGA) based on SPM8 or SPM12 and lesion prediction algorithm (LPA) based on SPM12) as first described by Schmidt et al. (2012). Additionally, manual segmentation was performed by three independent raters. We calculated inter-rater correlation coefficients (ICC) and dice coefficients (DC) for all possible pairwise comparisons. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS$\backslash$nWe found a strong correlation between manual and automated lesion segmentation based on LGA SPM8, regarding lesion volume (ICC=0.958 and DC=0.60) that was not statistically different from the inter-rater correlation (ICC=0.97 and DC=0.66). Correlation between the two other algorithms (LGA SPM12 and LPA SPM12) and manual raters was weaker but still adequate (ICC=0.927 and DC=0.53 for LGA SPM12 and ICC=0.949 and DC=0.57 for LPA SPM12). Variability of both manual and automated segmentation was significantly higher regarding lesion numbers. CONCLUSION: Automated lesion volume quantification can be applied reliably on FLAIR data sets using the SPM based algorithm of Schmidt et al. and shows good agreement with manual segmentation.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: In the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS), the most important therapeutic aim of disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) is to prevent or postpone long-term disability. Given the typically slow progression observed in the majority of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients, the primary endpoint for most randomized clinical trials (RCTs) is a reduction in relapse rate. It is widely assumed that reducing relapse rate will slow disability progression. Similarly, MRI studies suggest that reducing T2 lesions will be associated with slowing long-term disability in MS. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between treatment effects on relapse rates and active T2 lesions to differences in disease progression (as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS]) in trials evaluating patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), RRMS, and secondary progressive MS (SPMS).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted in Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, and PsycINFO to identify randomized trials published in English from January 1, 1993-June 3, 2013 evaluating DMTs in adult MS patients using keywords for CIS, RRMS, and SPMS combined with keywords for relapse and recurrence. Eligible studies were required to report outcomes of relapse and T2 lesion changes or disease progression in CIS, RRMS, or SPMS patients receiving DMTs and have a follow-up duration of at least 22 months. Ultimately, 40 studies satisfied these criteria for inclusion. Regression analyses were conducted on RCTs to relate differences between the effect of treatments on relapse rates and on active T2 lesions to differences between the effects of treatments on disease progression (as measured by EDSS).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Regression analysis determined there is a substantive clinically and statistically significant association between concurrent treatment effects in relapse rate and EDSS; p {\textless} 0.01. Lower treatment effects were associated with higher relative rates of disease progression. Significant associations between T2 lesion measures and EDSS measures also were found (p {\textless} 0.05), with some suggestion that the strength of the association may differ for older versus newer DMTs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Treatment differences in relapse reduction and T2 lesions are positively related to differences in disease progression over the first two years of treatment.},

It corrects for MR field inhomogeneities, estimates tissue-specific intensity models from the data itself, and incorporates contextual information in the classification using a Markov random field. The results of the automated method are compared with lesion delineations by human experts, showing a high total lesion load correlation. When the degree of spatial correspondence between segmentations is taken into account, considerable disagreement is found, both between expect segmentations, and between expert and automatic measurements.},

Here a new approach to the correction of intra-slice intensity variations is presented. Results demonstrate that the correction process enhances the performance of backpropagation neural network classifiers designed for the segmentation of the images. Two slightly different versions of the method are presented. The first version fits an intensity correction surface directly to reference points selected by the user in the images.

Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of both methods reveals that the first one leads to a better correction of the images than the second but that it is more sensitive to operator errors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE In contrast to "normal-appearing" white matter (NAWM) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), there are subtle, abnormal and diffuse signal intensity changes often seen on T2-weighted MR images, which we have referred to as "dirty-appearing" white matter (DAWM). These areas of DAWM have slightly higher signal intensity than that of NAWM, but lower than that of lesion plaques. Our study was designed to determine the volumetric and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) features of DAWM in patients with MS. METHODS Dual-echo fast spin-echo MR imaging and magnetization transfer imaging were performed in 22 patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Slightly hyperintense DAWM areas were manually outlined on the basis of T2-weighted imaging findings. The volume and MTR of DAWM were calculated and compared with the volume and MTR of NAWM and T2 lesion plaques. RESULTS The average volume of DAWM (18.3 mL) was greater than the average volume of T2 lesion plaques (11.0 mL, P =.04), and the mean MTR in DAWM (38.7{\%}) differed significantly (P {\textless}.0001) from that in NAWM (40.7{\%}) and plaques (33.3{\%}). There was a modest negative correlation between either mean MTR (r = -0.60; P =.003) of DAWM or peak height (r = -0.50; P =.02) of DAWM with T2 lesion load. Neither DAWM volume nor total T2 abnormality (DAWM + plaques) volume correlates with the Expanded Disability Status Scale. CONCLUSION The results of this study indicate that MTR is able to differentiate DAWM from lesion plaques and NAWM and that DAWM might be a different pathologic process of the disease. The notion and quantification of these subtle imaging findings of DAWM areas may improve our understanding of certain stages of disease progression and disease burden in patients with relapsing-remitting MS.},

  abstract = {Pelvic floor dysfunction is common in women after childbirth and precise segmentation of magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the pelvic floor may facilitate diagnosis and treatment of patients. However, because of the complexity of its structures, manual segmentation of the pelvic floor is challenging and suffers from high inter and intra-rater variability of expert raters. Multiple template fusion algorithms are promising segmentation techniques for these types of applications, but they have been limited by imperfections in the alignment of templates to the target, and by template segmentation errors. A number of algorithms sought to improve segmentation performance by combining image intensities and template labels as two independent sources of information, carrying out fusion through local intensity weighted voting schemes. This class of approach is a form of linear opinion pooling, and achieves unsatisfactory performance for this application. We hypothesized that better decision fusion could be achieved by assessing the contribution of each template in comparison to a reference standard segmentation of the target image and developed a novel segmentation algorithm to enable automatic segmentation of MRI of the female pelvic floor. The algorithm achieves high performance by estimating and compensating for both imperfect registration of the templates to the target image and template segmentation inaccuracies. A local image similarity measure is used to infer a local reliability weight, which contributes to the fusion through a novel logarithmic opinion pooling. We evaluated our new algorithm in comparison to nine state-of-the-art segmentation methods and demonstrated our algorithm achieves the highest performance.},

With a 1.5-MR unit we studied 12 Alzheimer patients, four subjects suffering from multiinfarct dementia and nine age-matched controls. Punctate or early confluent high-signal abnormalities in the deep white matter, noted in 60{\%} of both Alzheimer patients and controls, were unrelated to the presence of hypertension or other vascular risk factors. A significant number of Alzheimer patients exhibited a more extensive smooth "halo" of periventricular hyperintensity when compared with controls (p = .024). Widespread deep white-matter hyperintensity (two patients) and extensive, irregular periventricular hyperintensity (three patients) were seen in multiinfarct dementia. Areas of high signal intensity affecting hippocampal and sylvian cortex were also present in five Alzheimer and two multiinfarct dementia patients, but absent in controls. Discrete, small foci of deep white-matter hyperintensity are not characteristic of Alzheimer's disease nor do they appear to imply a vascular cause for the dementing illness. The frequently observed "halo" of periventricular hyperintensity in Alzheimer's disease may be of diagnostic importance. High-signal abnormalities in specific cortical regions are likely to reflect disease processes localized to those structures.},

Most modern methods optimize some intensity-based cost function to determine the best registration. To date, little attention has been focused on the optimization method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimization. This paper examines the optimization process in detail and demonstrates that the commonly used multiresolution local optimization methods can, and do, get trapped in local minima. To address this problem, two approaches are taken: (1) to apodize the cost function and (2) to employ a novel hybrid global-local optimization method. This new optimization method is specifically designed for registering whole brain images. It substantially reduces the likelihood of producing misregistrations due to being trapped by local minima. The increased robustness of the method, compared to other commonly used methods, is demonstrated by a consistency test. In addition, the accuracy of the registration is demonstrated by a series of experiments with motion correction. These motion correction experiments also investigate how the results are affected by different cost functions and interpolation methods. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

Quantitative evaluation of the proposed methods is carried out on publicly available labeled cases from the MICCAI MS Lesion Segmentation Challenge 2008 dataset.

The technique uses a trained support vector machine (SVM) to discriminate between the blocks in regions of MS lesions and the blocks in non-MS lesion regions mainly based on the textural features with aid of the other features. The classification is done on each of the axial, sagittal and coronal sectional brain view independently and the resultant segmentations are aggregated to provide more accurate output segmentation. The main contribution of the proposed technique described in this paper is the use of textural features to detect MS lesions in a fully automated approach that does not rely on manually delineating the MS lesions. In addition, the technique introduces the concept of the multi-sectional view segmentation to produce verified segmentation. The proposed textural-based SVM technique was evaluated using three simulated datasets and more than fifty real MRI datasets. The results were compared with state of the art methods. The obtained results indicate that the proposed method would be viable for use in clinical practice for the detection of MS lesions in MRI.},

  abstract      = {This paper presents a method for the coregistration and partitioning (i.e., tissue segmentation) of brain images that have been acquired in different modalities. The basic idea is that instead of matching two images directly, one performs intermediate within-modality registrations to two template images that are already in register. One can use a least-squares minimization to determine the affine transformations that map between the templates and the images. By incorporating suitable constraints, a rigid body transformation which directly maps between the images can be extracted from these more general affine transformations. A further refinement capitalizes on the implicit normalization of both images into a standard space. This facilitates segmentation or partitioning of both original images into homologous tissue classifications. Once partitioned, the partitions can be jointly matched, further increasing the accuracy of the coregistration. In short, these techniques reduce the between- modality problem to a series of simpler within-modality problems. These methods are relatively robust, address a number of problems in image transformations, and require no manual intervention. (C) 1997 Academic Press},

  abstract = {Detection of new Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is important as a marker of disease activity and as a potential surrogate for relapses. We propose an approach where sequential scans are jointly segmented, to provide a temporally consistent tissue segmentation while remaining sensitive to newly appearing lesions. The method uses a two-stage classification process: 1) a Bayesian classifier provides a probabilistic brain tissue classification at each voxel of reference and follow-up scans, and 2) a random-forest based lesion-level classification provides a final identification of new lesions. Generative models are learned based on 364 scans from 95 subjects from a multi-center clinical trial. The method is evaluated on sequential brain MRI of 160 subjects from a separate multi-center clinical trial, and is compared to 1) semi-automatically generated ground truth segmentations and 2) fully manual identification of new lesions generated independently by nine expert raters on a subset of 60 subjects. For new lesions greater than 0.15 cc in size, the classifier has near perfect performance (99{\%} sensitivity, 2{\%} false detection rate), as compared to ground truth. The proposed method was also shown to exceed the performance of any one of the nine expert manual identifications.},

Moreover, mutations in tau have been shown to cause a form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration in which tau neuronal inclusions observed in the brain are similar to those seen in AD. Here we review the more compelling strategies that are designed to reduce the contribution of misfolded tau to AD neuropathology, including those directed at correcting a possible loss of tau function resulting from sequestration of cellular tau and to minimizing possible gain-of-function toxicities caused by multimeric tau species. Finally, we discuss the challenges and potential benefits of tau-directed drug discovery programs.},

The approach adopted minimizes the residual squared difference between an image and a template of the same modality. In order to reduce the number of parameters to be fitted, the nonlinear warps are described by a linear combination of low spatial frequency basis functions. The objective is to determine the optimum coefficients for each of the bases by minimizing the sum of squared differences between the image and template, while simultaneously maximizing the smoothness of the transformation using a maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach. Most MAP approaches assume that the variance associated with each voxel is already known and that there is no covariance between neighboring voxels. The approach described here attempts to estimate this variance from the data, and also corrects for the correlations between neighboring voxels. This makes the same approach suitable for the spatial normalization of both high-quality magnetic resonance images, and low-resolution noisy positron emission tomography images. A fast algorithm has been developed that utilizes Taylor{\&}apos;s theorem and the separable nature of the basis functions, meaning that most of the nonlinear spatial variability between images can be automatically corrected within a few minutes.},

These foci, considered to represent lesions, are important in the study of various psychiatric illnesses, including depression. Few quantitative measures have been developed for such research. The goal of the current study was to develop a reliable and efficient method for quantifying the volumes of gray and white matter lesions in MRI scans of the elderly. Interrater reliability was determined by repeat lesion measures on 16 scans. Semi-automated segmentation was performed that identified potential lesions, and then lesions were manually selected based upon detailed anatomic criteria. The lesion quantification procedure took between 25 and 45 min per scan. Reliability intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were 0.99 for both gray and white matter lesions. Volumetric results were found to be moderately correlated with previous lesion ratings (r-values between 0.37 and 0.62, P{\textless}0.0001). Among the 700 scans processed with this method, lesion volumes ranged from 0 to 7.3 ml for gray matter, and from 0.4 to 96.8 ml for white matter. Our method proved to be efficient and reliable for quantifying lesions in MRI scans of the elderly. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {One of the major drawbacks of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been the lack of a standard and quantifiable interpretation of image intensities. Unlike in other modalities, such as X-ray computerized tomography, MR images taken for the same patient on the same scanner at different times may appear different from each other due to a variety of scanner-dependent variations and, therefore, the absolute intensity values do not have a fixed meaning. We have devised a two-step method wherein all images (independent of patients and the specific brand of the MR scanner used) can be transformed in such a way that for the same protocol and body region, in the transformed images similar intensities will have similar tissue meaning. Standardized images can be displayed with fixed windows without the need of per-case adjustment. More importantly, extraction of quantitative information about healthy organs or about abnormalities can be considerably simplified. This paper introduces and compares new variants of this standardizing method that can help to overcome some of the problems with the original method.},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is very sensitive for the detection of white matter lesions (WML), which occur even in normal ageing. Intrinsic WML should be separated from physiological changes in the ageing brain, such as periventricular caps and bands, and from dilated Virchow-Robin spaces. Genuine WML are best seen with T2-weighted sequences such as long TR dual-echo spin-echo or FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery); the latter has the advantage of easily separating WML from CSF-like lesions. Abnormal T2 signal in MRI is not specific, and can accompany any change in tissue composition. In the work-up of WML in small vessel disease, magnetic resonance angiography can be used to rule out (concomitant) large vessel disease, and diffusion-weighted MRI to identify new ischaemic lesions (amidst pre-existing old WML). The differential diagnosis of WML includes hereditary leukodystrophies and acquired disorders. The leukodystrophies that can present in adult age include metachromatic leukodystrophy, globoid cell leukodystrophy, adrenomyeloneuropathy, mitochondrial disorders, vanishing white matter, and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. These metabolic disorders typically present with symmetrical abnormalities that can be very diffuse, often with involvement of brainstem and cerebellum. Only the mitochondrial disorders tend to be more asymmetric and frequently involve the grey matter preferentially. Among the acquired white matter disorders, hypoxic-ischaemic causes are by far the most prevalent and without further clinical clues there is no need to even consider the next most common disorder, i.e. multiple sclerosis (MS). Among the nonischaemic disorders, MS is far more common than vasculitis, infection, intoxication and trauma. While vasculitis can mimic small vessel disease, MS has distinctive features with preferential involvement of the subcortical U-fibres, the corpus callosum, temporal lobes and the brainstem/cerebellum. Spinal cord lesions are very common in MS, but do not occur in normal ageing nor in small vessel disease.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop a method to automatically detect multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions, located both in white matter (WM) and in the cortex, in patients with low disability and early disease stage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a lesion detection method, based on the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) technique, to detect lesions as small as 0.0036 mL. This method uses the image intensity information from up to four different 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences (magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo, MPRAGE; magnetization-prepared two inversion-contrast rapid gradient-echo, MP2RAGE; 3D fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, FLAIR; and 3D double-inversion recovery, DIR), acquired on a 3T scanner. To these intensity features we added the information obtained by the spatial coordinates and tissue prior probabilities provided by the International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM). Quantitative assessment was done in 39 early-stage MS patients with a "leave-one-out" cross-validation. RESULTS: The best lesion detection rate (DR) performance in WM was obtained using MP2RAGE, FLAIR, and DIR intensities (77{\%} for lesions ≥0.0036 mL; 85{\%} for lesions ≥0.005 mL). Similar results were obtained excluding the DIR intensity as well as when using only MPRAGE and FLAIR (DR = 75{\%}, P = 0.5720). However, the combination of FLAIR with DIR and MP2RAGE appeared to be the best for detecting cortical lesions (DR = 62{\%}), compared to the other combination of sequences (P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSION: For WM lesion detection, similar results were observed when only conventional clinical sequences (FLAIR, MPRAGE) were used compared to a combination of conventional and "advanced" sequences (MP2RAGE, DIR). Cortical lesion detection increased significantly when "advanced" sequences were used. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2015.},

Data extraction Population studied, duration of follow-up, method used to measure white matter hyperintensities, definition of the outcome, and measure of the association of white matter hyperintensities with the outcome. Data synthesis 46 longitudinal studies evaluated the association of white matter hyperintensities with risk of stroke (n=12), cognitive decline (n=19), dementia (n=17), and death (n=10). 22 studies could be included in a meta-analysis (nine of stroke, nine of dementia, eight of death). White matter hyperintensities were associated with an increased risk of stroke (hazard ratio 3.3, 95{\%} confidence interval 2.6 to 4.4), dementia (1.9, 1.3 to 2.8), and death (2.0, 1.6 to 2.7). An association of white matter hyperintensities with a faster decline in global cognitive performance, executive function, and processing speed was also suggested. Conclusion White matter hyperintensities predict an increased risk of stroke, dementia, and death. Therefore white matter hyperintensities indicate an increased risk of cerebrovascular events when identified as part of diagnostic investigations, and support their use as an intermediate marker in a research setting. Their discovery should prompt detailed screening for risk factors of stroke and dementia.},

  abstract  = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an ever-expanding role in the evaluation of multiple sclerosis (MS). This includes its sensitivity for the diagnosis of the disease and its role in identifying patients at high risk for conversion to MS after a first presentation with selected clinically isolated syndromes. In addition, MRI is a key tool in providing primary therapeutic outcome measures for phase I/II trials and secondary outcome measures in phase III trials. The utility of MRI stems from its sensitivity to longitudinal changes including those in overt lesions and, with advanced MRI techniques, in areas affected by diffuse occult disease (the so-called normal-appearing brain tissue). However, all current MRI methodology suffers from limited specificity for the underlying histopathology. Conventional MRI techniques, including lesion detection and measurement of atrophy from T1- or T2-weighted images, have been the mainstay for monitoring disease activity in clinical trials, in which the use of gadolinium with T1-weighted images adds additional sensitivity and specificity for areas of acute inflammation. Advanced imaging methods including magnetization transfer, fluid attenuated inversion recovery, diffusion, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, functional MRI, and nuclear imaging techniques have added to our understanding of the pathogenesis of MS and may provide methods to monitor therapies more sensitively in the future. However, these advanced methods are limited by their cost, availability, complexity, and lack of validation. In this article, we review the role of conventional and advanced imaging techniques with an emphasis on neurotherapeutics.},

  abstract   = {The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a histogram-based model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation-no spatial information is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not the the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias field distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods produce unreliable results. Here, the authors propose a novel hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically, it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the HMRF model. The advantage of the HMRF model derives from the way in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences of neighboring sites. Although MRF modeling has been employed in MR image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods are limited to using MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based approach. To fit the HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. The authors show that by incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into a HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved. More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be combined with other techniques. As an example, the authors show how the bias field correction algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997) can be incorporated into this framework to achieve a three-dimensional fully automated approach for brain MR image segmentation.},

The first two extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domains of PirB and LilrB2 mediate this interaction, leading to enhanced cofilin signaling, also seen in human AD brains. In mice, the deleterious effect of Ab oligomers on hippocampal long-term potentiation required PirB, and in a transgenic model of AD, PirB not only contributed to memory deficits present in adult mice, but also mediated loss of synaptic plasticity in juvenile visual cortex.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CSF pulsation artifact is a pitfall of fast fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) brain MR imaging. We studied ventricular CSF pulsation artifact (VCSFA) on axial FLAIR images and its relationship to age and ventricular size. METHODS: Fast FLAIR axial images were obtained on a 1.5-T unit (8000/150/2 [TR/TE/ excitations], inversion time = 2200, field of view = 24 cm, matrix = 189x256, and 5-mm interleaved sections). Two observers rated VCSFA (hyperintensity on FLAIR images) in the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles by using a three-point ordinal scale in 100 consecutive subjects (ages 20-86 years) with normal brain MR studies. Left-to-right third ventricular width was also measured. RESULTS: Seventy-two subjects had VCSFA in at least one ventricular cavity. The fourth ventricle was the most common site of VCSFA (n = 58), followed by the third ventricle (n = 47) and the lateral ventricles (n = 13). VCSFA was usually severe in the third and fourth ventricles and less severe in the lateral ventricles. Fourth ventricular VCSFA was significantly associated with third ventricular VCSFA. Increasing third ventricular size and, to a lesser extent, increasing age was significantly associated with VCSFA. Ghost pulsation of VCSFA occurred across the brain parenchyma in the phase-encoding direction. VCSFA seen in the fourth ventricle on axial FLAIR images disappeared on sagittal FLAIR images in one subject. CONCLUSION: VCSFA on axial FLAIR images represents inflow artifact caused by inversion delay and ghosting effects. VCSFA might obscure or mimic intraventricular lesions, especially in the third and fourth ventricles. Although common in adults of all ages, VCSFA is associated with advancing age and increasing ventricular size. Thus, altered CSF flow dynamics that occur with ventriculomegaly and aging contribute to VCSFA on axial FLAIR MR images.},

Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) is an advanced magnetic resonance imaging sequence that reveals tissue T2 prolongation with cerebrospinal fluid suppression, allowing detection of superficial brain lesions. OBJECTIVES: To assess FLAIR, T1-weighted, and T2-weighted images for detecting lesions in or near the cerebral cortex in patients with MS and to explore the relation between cortical lesions and cortical atrophy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Cross-sectional study in a university MS clinic of 84 patients with MS and 66 age-matched healthy controls receiving 1.5-T fast FLAIR, T2-weighted, and T1-weighted images. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Regional cortical atrophy was rated vs controls. Cortical and juxtacortical lesions were ovoid hyperintensities involving the cortex and/or gray-white junction. RESULTS: A total of 810 cortical and juxtacortical lesions were seen by FLAIR in patients (mean, 9.6 per patient), most commonly in the superior frontal lobe. Cortical and juxtacortical lesions were identified in 72 patients and 6 controls. Fourteen percent of cortical and juxtacortical lesions were seen on T1-weighted images and 26{\%} were seen on T2-weighted images. More cortical and juxtacortical lesions were present in secondary progressive disease than relapsing-remitting disease. The total number of cortical and juxtacortical lesions correlated significantly with disease duration and the regional number correlated with the degree of regional atrophy. After taking into account noncortical (white matter) lesions, only the cortical and juxtacortical lesion count predicted atrophy in that region. CONCLUSIONS: FLAIR can detect many cortical and juxtacortical lesions in MS, which were appreciated previously in autopsy studies but usually missed by magnetic resonance imaging during life. Cortical and juxtacortical plaque formation may contribute to cortical atrophy in MS.},

This is mainly because WMH may reflect co-morbid neural injury or cerebral vascular disease burden. WMH in the older population may be small, diffuse, and irregular in shape, and sufficiently heterogeneous within and across subjects. Here, we pose hyperintensity detection as a supervised inference problem and adapt two learning models, specifically, Support Vector Machines and Random Forests, for this task. Using texture features engineered by texton filter banks, we provide a suite of effective segmentation methods for this problem. Through extensive evaluations on healthy middle-aged and older adults who vary in AD risk, we show that our methods are reliable and robust in segmenting hyperintense regions. A measure of hyperintensity accumulation, referred to as normalized effective WMH volume, is shown to be associated with dementia in older adults and parental family history in cognitively normal subjects. We provide an open source library for hyperintensity detection and accumulation (interfaced with existing neuroimaging tools), that can be adapted for segmentation problems in other neuroimaging studies.},

  abstract = {T2* relaxation refers to decay of transverse magnetization caused by a combination of spin-spin relaxation and magnetic field inhomogeneity. T2* relaxation is seen only with gradient-echo (GRE) imaging because transverse relaxation caused by magnetic field inhomogeneities is eliminated by the 180 degrees pulse at spin-echo imaging. T2* relaxation is one of the main determinants of image contrast with GRE sequences and forms the basis for many magnetic resonance (MR) applications, such as susceptibility-weighted (SW) imaging, perfusion MR imaging, and functional MR imaging. GRE sequences can be made predominantly T2* weighted by using a low flip angle, long echo time, and long repetition time. GRE sequences with T2*-based contrast are used to depict hemorrhage, calcification, and iron deposition in various tissues and lesions. SW imaging uses phase information in addition to T2*-based contrast to exploit the magnetic susceptibility differences of the blood and of iron and calcification in various tissues. Perfusion MR imaging exploits the signal intensity decrease that occurs with the passage of a high concentration of gadopentetate dimeglumine through the microvasculature. Change in oxygen saturation during specific tasks changes the local T2*, which leads to the blood oxygen level-dependent effect seen at functional MR imaging. The basics of T2* relaxation, T2*-weighted sequences, and their clinical applications are presented, followed by the principles, techniques, and clinical uses of four T2*-based applications, including SW imaging, perfusion MR imaging, functional MR imaging, and iron overload imaging},

Several methods are available for performing white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume quantification. They vary in the amount of the human interaction involved. In this paper, we describe a fully automatic segmentation that was used to quantify WMHs in a large clinical trial on elderly subjects. Our segmentation method combines information from 3 different MR images: proton density (PD), T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images; our method uses an established artificial intelligent technique (fuzzy inference system) and does not require extensive computations. The reproducibility of the segmentation was evaluated in 9 patients who underwent scan–rescan with repositioning; an inter-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.91 was obtained. The effect of differences in image resolution was tested in 44 patients, scanned with 6- and 3-mm slice thickness FLAIR images; we obtained an ICC value of 0.99. The accuracy of the segmentation was evaluated on 100 patients for whom manual delineation of WMHs was available; the obtained ICC was 0.98 and the similarity index was 0.75. Besides the fact that the approach demonstrated very high volumetric and spatial agreement with expert delineation, the software did not require more than 2 min per patient (from loading the images to saving the results) on a Pentium-4 processor (512 MB RAM).},

  abstract      = {Magnetic resonance imaging is a popular and powerful non-invasive imaging technique. Automated analysis has become mandatory to efficiently cope with the large amount of data generated using this modality. However, several artifacts, such as intensity non-uniformity, can degrade the quality of acquired data. Intensity non-uniformity consists in anatomically irrelevant intensity variation throughout data. It can be induced by the choice of the radio-frequency coil, the acquisition pulse sequence and by the nature and geometry of the sample itself. Numerous methods have been proposed to correct this artifact. In this paper, we propose an overview of existing methods. We first sort them according to their location in the acquisition/processing pipeline. Sorting is then refined based on the assumptions those methods rely on. Next, we present the validation protocols used to evaluate these different correction schemes both from a qualitative and a quantitative point of view. Finally, availability and usability of the presented methods is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {In Multiple Sclerosis (MS), detection of T2-hyperintense white matter (WM) lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a crucial criterion for diagnosis and predicting prognosis in early disease. Automated lesion detection is not only desirable with regard to time and cost effectiveness but also constitutes a prerequisite to minimize user bias. Here, we developed and evaluated an algorithm for automated lesion detection requiring a three-dimensional (3D) gradient echo (GRE) T1-weighted and a FLAIR image at 3 Tesla (T). Our tool determines the three tissue classes of gray matter (GM) and WM as well as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the T1-weighted image, and, then, the FLAIR intensity distribution of each tissue class in order to detect outliers, which are interpreted as lesion beliefs. Next, a conservative lesion belief is expanded toward a liberal lesion belief. To this end, neighboring voxels are analyzed and assigned to lesions under certain conditions. This is done iteratively until no further voxels are assigned to lesions. Herein, the likelihood of belonging to WM or GM is weighed against the likelihood of belonging to lesions. We evaluated our algorithm in 53 MS patients with different lesion volumes, in 10 patients with posterior fossa lesions, and 18 control subjects that were all scanned at the same 3T scanner (Achieva, Philips, Netherlands). We found good agreement with lesions determined by manual tracing (R2 values of over 0.93 independent of FLAIR slice thickness up to 6mm). These results require validation with data from other protocols based on a conventional FLAIR sequence and a 3D GRE T1-weighted sequence. Yet, we believe that our tool allows fast and reliable segmentation of FLAIR-hyperintense lesions, which might simplify the quantification of lesions in basic research and even clinical trials.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a method for detection of cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMH) based on run-time PD-, T1-, and T2-weighted structural magnetic resonance (MR) images of the brain along with labeled training examples. Unlike most prior approaches, the method is able to reliably detect WMHs in elderly brains in the absence of fluid-attenuated (FLAIR) images. Its success is due to the learning of probabilistic models of WMH spatial distribution and neighborhood dependencies from ground-truth examples of FLAIR-based WMH detections. These models are combined with a probabilistic model of the PD, T1, and T2 intensities of WMHs in a Markov Random Field (MRF) framework that provides the machinery for inferring the positions of WMHs in novel test images. The method is shown to accurately detect WMHs in a set of 114 elderly subjects from an academic dementia clinic. Experiments show that standard off-the-shelf MRF training and inference methods provide robust results, and that increasing the complexity of neighborhood dependency models does not necessarily help performance. The method is also shown to perform well when training and test data are drawn from distinct scanners and subject pools.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE White matter lesions are often seen on MR scans of elderly non-demented and demented people. They are attributed to degenerative changes of small vessels and are implicated in the pathogenesis of cognitive decline and dementia. There is evidence that especially periventricular white matter lesions are related to cognitive decline, whereas subcortical white matter lesions may be related to late onset depression. The frequency distribution of subcortical and periventricular white matter lesions according to age and sex reported. METHODS A total of 1077 subjects aged between 60–90 years were randomly sampled from the general population. All subjects underwent 1.5T MR scanning; white matter lesions were rated separately for the subcortical region and the periventricular region. RESULTS Of all subjects 8{\%} were completely free of subcortical white matter lesions, 20{\%} had no periventricular white matter lesions, and 5{\%} had no white matter lesions in either of these locations. The proportion with white matter lesions increased with age, similarly for men and women. Women tended to have more subcortical white matter lesions than men (total volume 1.45 ml v 1.29 ml; p=0.33), mainly caused by marked differences in the frontal white matter lesion volume (0.89 ml v 0.70 ml; p=0.08). Periventricular white matter lesions were also more frequent among women than men (mean grade 2.5 v 2.3; p=0.07). Also severe degrees of subcortical white matter lesions were more common in women than in men (OR 1.1; 95{\%} confidence interval (95{\%} CI) 0.8–1.5) and periventricular white matter lesions (OR 1.2; 95{\%} CI 0.9–1.7), albeit that none of these findings were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence and the degree of cerebral white matter lesions increased with age. Women tended to have a higher degree of white matter lesions than men. This may underlie the finding of a higher incidence of dementia in women than in men, particularly at later age.},

  abstract  = {The idea of data augmentation arises naturally in missing value problems, as exemplified by the standard ways of filling in missing cells in balanced two-way tables. Thus data augmentation refers to a scheme of augmenting the observed data so as to make it more easy to analyze. This device is used to great advantage by the EM algorithm (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977) in solving maximum likelihood problems. In situations when the likelihood cannot be approximated closely by the normal likelihood, maximum likelihood estimates and the associated standard errors cannot be relied upon to make valid inferential statements. From the Bayesian point of view, one must now calculate the posterior distribution of parameters of interest. If data augmentation can be used in the calculation of the maximum likelihood estimate, then in the same cases one ought to be able to use it in the computation of the posterior distribution. It is the purpose of this article to explain how this can be done. The basic idea is quite simple. The observed data y is augmented by the quantity z, which is referred to as the latent data. It is assumed that if y and z are both known, then the problem is straightforward to analyze, that is, the augmented data posterior p({\&}{\#}952;{\&}{\#}8739;y, z) can be calculated. But the posterior density that we want is p({\&}{\#}952; {\&}{\#}8739;y), which may be difficult to calculate directly. If, however, one can generate multiple values of z from the predictive distribution p(z {\&}{\#}8739;y) (i.e., multiple imputations of z), then p({\&}{\#}952; {\&}{\#}8739;y) can be approximately obtained as the average of p({\&}{\#}952;{\&}{\#}8739;y, z) over the imputed z's. However, p(z {\&}{\#}8739;y) depends, in turn, on p({\&}{\#}952; {\&}{\#}8739;y). Hence if p({\&}{\#}952; {\&}{\#}8739;y) was known, it could be used to calculate p(z {\&}{\#}8739;y). This mutual dependency between p({\&}{\#}952; {\&}{\#}8739;y) and p(z {\&}{\#}8739;y) leads to an iterative algorithm to calculate p({\&}{\#}952; {\&}{\#}8739;y). Analytically, this algorithm is essentially the method of successive substitution for solving an operator fixed point equation. We exploit this fact to prove convergence under mild regularity conditions. Typically, to implement the algorithm, one must be able to sample from two distributions, namely p({\&}{\#}952; {\&}{\#}8739;y, z) and p(z {\&}{\#}8739;{\&}{\#}952;, y). In many cases, it is straightforward to sample from either distribution. In general, though, either sampling can be difficult, just as either the E or the M step can be difficult to implement in the EM algorithm. For p({\&}{\#}952; {\&}{\#}8739;y, z) arising from parametric submodels of the multinomial, we develop a primitive but generally applicable way to approximately sample {\&}{\#}952;. The idea is first to sample from the posterior distribution of the cell probabilities and then to project to the parametric surface that is specified by the submodel, giving more weight to those observations lying closer to the surface. This procedure should cover many of the common models for categorical data. There are several examples given in this article. First, the algorithm is introduced and motivated in the context of a genetic linkage example. Second, we apply this algorithm to an example of inference from incomplete data regarding the correlation coefficient of the bivariate normal distribution. It is seen that the algorithm recovers the bimodal nature of the posterior distribution. Finally, the algorithm is used in the analysis of the traditional latent-class model as applied to data from the General Social Survey.},

  abstract = {Fitting regression models can be challenging when regression coefficients are high-dimensional. Especially when large spatial or temporal effects need to be taken into account the limits of computational capacities of normal working stations are reached quickly. The analysis of images with several million pixels, where each pixel value can be seen as an observation on a new spatial location, represent such a situation. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework for the applied statistician is presented that allows to fit models with millions of parameters with only low to moderate computational requirements. The method combines a modified sampling scheme with novel accomplishments in iterative methods for sparse linear systems. This way a solution is given that eliminates potential computational burdens such as calculating the log-determinant of massive precision matrices and sampling from high-dimensional Gaussian distributions. In an extensive simulation study with models of moderate size it is shown that this approach gives results that are in perfect agreement with state-of-the-art methods for fitting structured additive regression models. Furthermore, the method is applied to two real world examples from the field of medical imaging.},

The algorithm uses information from T1-weighted (T1-w), inversion recovery (IR), proton density-weighted (PD), T2-weighted (T2-w) and fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) scans. It is based on the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classification technique that builds a feature space from voxel intensities and spatial information. The technique generates images representing the probability per voxel being part of a WML. By application of thresholds on these probability maps, binary segmentations can be obtained. ROC curves show that the segmentations achieve both high sensitivity and specificity. A similarity index (SI), overlap fraction (OF) and extra fraction (EF) are calculated for additional quantitative analysis of the result. The SI is also used for determination of the optimal probability threshold for generation of the binary segmentation. Using probabilistic equivalents of the SI, OF and EF, the probability maps can be evaluated directly, providing a powerful tool for comparison of different classification results. This method for automated WML segmentation reaches an accuracy that is comparable to methods for multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation and is suitable for detection of WMLs in large and longitudinal population studies.},

  abstract  = {Therapies that target the underlying pathology of multiple sclerosis (MS), including focal and diffuse damage, may improve long-term disease control. Focal damage (inflammatory lesions) manifests clinically mainly as relapses, whereas diffuse damage (neurodegeneration and brain volume loss) has been more closely associated with disability progression and cognitive decline. Given that first-line therapies such as beta-interferon and glatiramer acetate, which are primarily directed against inflammation, might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients, it has been recommended to switch these patients early to a therapy of higher efficacy, possibly targeting both components of MS pathology more rigorously. This review provides an overview of the efficacy of EU-approved disease-modifying therapies on conventional MS outcome measures (relapses, disability progression and paraclinical magnetic resonance imaging endpoints) in addition to brain volume loss, a measure of diffuse damage in the brain. In addition, the evidence supporting early treatment optimization in patients with high disease activity despite first-line therapy will be reviewed and an algorithm for optimal disease control will be presented.},

This paper presents a method designed to detect hyperintense signal area on T2-FLAIR sequence and its results on the Challenge test data. The proposed algorithm uses only three conventional MRI sequences: T1, T2 and T2-FLAIR. First, images are cropped, spatially unbiased and skull-stripped. A segmentation of the brain into its different compartments is performed on the T1 and the T2 sequences. From these segmentations, a threshold for the T2-FLAIR sequence is automatically computed. Then postprocessing operations select the most plausible lesions in the obtained hyperintense signals. Average global result on the test data (80/100) is close to the inter-expert variability (90/100).},

Through an International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM) a dataset is being collected that includes 7000 subjects between the ages of eighteen and ninety years and including 342 mono- and dizygotic twins. Data on each subject includes detailed demographic, clinical, behavioural and imaging information. DNA has been collected for genotyping from 5800 subjects. A component of the programme uses post-mortem tissue to determine the probabilistic distribution of microscopic cyto- and chemoarchitectural regions in the human brain. This, combined with macroscopic information about structure and function derived from subjects in vivo, provides the first large scale opportunity to gain meaningful insights into the concordance or discordance in micro- and macroscopic structure and function. The philosophy, strategy, algorithm development, data acquisition techniques and validation methods are described in this report along with database structures. Examples of results are described for the normal adult human brain as well as examples in patients with Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. The ability to quantify the variance of the human brain as a function of age in a large population of subjects for whom data is also available about their genetic composition and behaviour will allow for the first assessment of cerebral genotype-phenotype-behavioural correlations in humans to take place in a population this large. This approach and its application should provide new insights and opportunities for investigators interested in basic neuroscience, clinical diagnostics and the evaluation of neuropsychiatric disorders in patients.},

  abstract  = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating disease characterized by synaptic and neuronal loss in the elderly. Compelling evidence suggests that soluble amyloid-$\beta$ peptide (A$\beta$) oligomers induce synaptic loss in AD. A$\beta$-induced synaptic dysfunction is dependent on overstimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) resulting in aberrant activation of redox-mediated events as well as elevation of cytoplasmic Ca 2+ , which in turn triggers downstream pathways involving phospho-tau (p-tau), caspases, Cdk5/dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), calcineurin/PP2B, PP2A, Gsk-3$\beta$, Fyn, cofilin, and CaMKII and causes endocytosis of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) as well as NMDARs. Dysfunction in these pathways leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, bioenergetic compromise and consequent synaptic dysfunction and loss, impaired long-term potentiation (LTP), and cognitive decline. Evidence also suggests that A$\beta$ may, at least in part, mediate these events by causing an aberrant rise in extrasynaptic glutamate levels by inhibiting glutamate uptake or triggering glutamate release from glial cells. Consequent extrasynaptic NMDAR (eNMDAR) overstimulation then results in synaptic dysfunction via the aforementioned pathways. Consistent with this model of A$\beta$-induced synaptic loss, A$\beta$ synaptic toxicity can be partially ameliorated by the NMDAR antagonists (such as memantine and NitroMemantine). PSD-95, an important scaffolding protein that regulates synaptic distribution and activity of both NMDA and AMPA receptors, is also functionally disrupted by A$\beta$. PSD-95 dysregulation is likely an important intermediate step in the pathological cascade of events caused by A$\beta$. In summary, A$\beta$-induced synaptic dysfunction is a complicated process involving multiple pathways, components and biological events, and their underlying mechanisms, albeit as yet incompletely understood, may offer hope for new therapeutic avenues.},

  abstract  = {Criteria for the diagnosis of vascular dementia (VaD) that are reliable, valid, and readily applicable in a variety of settings are urgently needed for both clinical and research purposes. To address this need, the Neuroepidemiology Branch of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) convened an International Workshop with support from the Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (AIREN), resulting in research criteria for the diagnosis of VaD. Compared with other current criteria, these guidelines emphasize (1) the heterogeneity of vascular dementia syndromes and pathologic subtypes including ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, cerebral hypoxic-ischemic events, and senile leukoencephalopathic lesions; (2) the variability in clinical course, which may be static, remitting, or progressive; (3) specific clinical findings early in the course (eg, gait disorder, incontinence, or mood and personality changes) that support a vascular rather than a degenerative cause; (4) the need to establish a temporal relationship between stroke and dementia onset for a secure diagnosis; (5) the importance of brain imaging to support clinical findings; (6) the value of neuropsychological testing to document impairments in multiple cognitive domains; and (7) a protocol for neuropathologic evaluations and correlative studies of clinical, radiologic, and neuropsychological features. These criteria are intended as a guide for case definition in neuroepidemiologic studies, stratified by levels of certainty (definite, probable, and possible). They await testing and validation and will be revised as more information becomes available.},

The workgroup sought to ensure that the revised criteria would be flexible enough to be used by both general healthcare providers without access to neuropsychological testing, advanced imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid measures, and specialized investigators involved in research or in clinical trial studies who would have these tools available. We present criteria for all-cause dementia and for AD dementia. We retained the general framework of probable AD dementia from the 1984 criteria. On the basis of the past 27 years of experience, we made several changes in the clinical criteria for the diagnosis. We also retained the term possible AD dementia, but redefined it in a manner more focused than before. Biomarker evidence was also integrated into the diagnostic formulations for probable and possible AD dementia for use in research settings. The core clinical criteria for AD dementia will continue to be the cornerstone of the diagnosis in clinical practice, but biomarker evidence is expected to enhance the pathophysiological specificity of the diagnosis of AD dementia. Much work lies ahead for validating the biomarker diagnosis of AD dementia. ?? 2011 The Alzheimer's Association. All rights reserved.},

  abstract      = {Subject motion during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been problematic since its introduction as a clinical imaging modality. While sensitivity to particle motion or blood flow can be used to provide useful image contrast, bulk motion presents a considerable problem in the majority of clinical applications. It is one of the most frequent sources of artifacts. Over 30 years of research have produced numerous methods to mitigate or correct for motion artifacts, but no single method can be applied in all imaging situations. Instead, a ``toolbox{\{}''{\}} of methods exists, where each tool is suitable for some tasks, but not for others. This article reviews the origins of motion artifacts and presents current mitigation and correction methods. In some imaging situations, the currently available motion correction tools are highly effective; in other cases, appropriate tools still need to be developed. It seems likely that this multifaceted approach will be what eventually solves the motion sensitivity problem in MRI, rather than a single solution that is effective in all situations. This review places a strong emphasis on explaining the physics behind the occurrence of such artifacts, with the aim of aiding artifact detection and mitigation in particular clinical situations.},

We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

In this manuscript we describe the design and evaluation of a Bayesian lesion-segmentation method, with the expectation that our approach would segment white-matter brain lesions in MR images without user intervention. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Each ACCORD-MIND subject has T1-weighted, T2-weighted, spin-density-weighted, and FLAIR sequences. The training portion of our algorithm first registers training images to a standard coordinate space; then, it collects statistics that capture signal-intensity information, and residual spatial variability of normal structures and lesions. The classification portion of our algorithm then uses these statistics to segment lesions in images from new subjects, without the need for user intervention. We evaluated this algorithm using 42 subjects with primarily white-matter lesions from the ACCORD-MIND project. RESULTS: Our experiments demonstrated high classification accuracy, using an expert neuroradiologist as a standard. CONCLUSIONS: A Bayesian lesion-segmentation algorithm that collects multi-channel signal-intensity and spatial information from MR images of the brain shows potential for accurately segmenting brain lesions in images obtained from subjects not used in training.},

L1 regularized logistic regression requires solving a convex optimization problem. However, standard algorithms for solving convex optimization problems do not scale well enough to handle the large datasets encountered in many practical settings. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for L1 regularized logistic regression. Our algorithm iteratively approximates the objective function by a quadratic approximation at the current point, while maintaining the L1 constraint. In each iteration, it uses the efficient LARS (Least Angle Regression) algorithm to solve the resulting L1 constrained quadratic optimization problem. Our theoretical results show that our algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the global optimum. Our experiments show that our algorithm significantly outperforms standard algorithms for solving convex optimization problems. Moreover, our algorithm outperforms four previously published algorithms that were specifically designed to solve the L1 regularized logistic regression problem.},

The current guidelines involve the revision of the dementia syndromes outside of AD, notably vascular cognitive impairment, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, dementia with Lewy bodies, corticobasal syndrome, progressive supranuclear palsy, Parkinson's disease dementia, Huntington's disease, prion diseases, normal-pressure hydrocephalus, limbic encephalitis and other toxic and metabolic disorders. The aim is to present a peer-reviewed evidence-based statement for the guidance of practice for clinical neurologists, geriatricians, psychiatrists and other specialist physicians responsible for the care of patients with dementing disorders. It represents a statement of minimum desirable standards for practice guidance. Methods: The task force working group reviewed evidence from original research articles, meta-analyses and systematic reviews, published by June 2011. The evidence was classified (I, II, III, IV) and consensus recommendations graded (A, B, or C) according to the EFNS guidance. Where there was a lack of evidence, but clear consensus, good practice points were provided. Results and conclusions: New recommendations and good practice points are made for clinical diagnosis, blood tests, neuropsychology, neuroimaging, electroencephalography, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, genetic testing, disclosure of diagnosis, treatment of behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia, legal issues, counselling and support for caregivers. All recommendations were revised as compared with the previous EFNS guidelines. The specialist neurologist together with primary care physicians play an important role in the assessment, interpretation and treatment of symptoms, disability and needs of dementia patients. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s) European Journal of Neurology {\textcopyright} 2012 EFNS.},

Manually segmenting WMHs in large cohorts is technically unfeasible due to time and accuracy concerns. Automated tools that can detect WMHs robustly and with high accuracy are needed. Here we present and validate a fully automatic technique for segmentation and volumetric quantification of WMHs in aging and AD. The proposed technique combines intensity and location features from multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrasts and manually labeled training data with a linear classifier to perform fast and robust segmentations. It provides both a continuous subject specific WMH map reflecting different levels of tissue damage and binary segmentations. The method was used to detect WMHs in 80 elderly/AD brains (ADC dataset) as well as 40 healthy subjects at risk of AD (PREVENT-AD dataset). Robustness across different scanners was validated using 10 subjects from ADNI2/GO study. Voxel-wise and volumetric agreements were evaluated using Dice similarity index (SI) and intra-class correlation (ICC), yielding ICC=0.96, SI=0.62±0.16 for ADC dataset and ICC=0.78, SI=0.51±0.15 for PREVENT-AD dataset. The proposed method was robust in the independent sample yielding SI=0.64±0.17 with ICC=0.93 for ADNI2/GO subjects. The proposed method provides fast, accurate and robust segmentations on previously unseen data from different models of scanners, making it ideal to study WMHs in large scale multi-site studies},

Recent work in the automated segmentation of white matter lesions from magnetic resonance imaging has utilized a model in which lesions are outliers in the distribution of tissue signal intensities across the entire brain of each patient. However, the sensitivity and specificity of lesion detection and segmentation with these approaches have been inadequate. In our analysis, we determined this is due to the substantial overlap between the whole brain signal intensity distribution of lesions and normal tissue. Inspired by the ability of experts to detect lesions based on their local signal intensity characteristics, we propose a new algorithm that achieves lesion and brain tissue segmentation through simultaneous estimation of a spatially global within-the-subject intensity distribution and a spatially local intensity distribution derived from a healthy reference population. We demonstrate that MS lesions can be segmented as outliers from this intensity model of population and subject. We carried out extensive experiments with both synthetic and clinical data, and compared the performance of our new algorithm to those of state-of-the art techniques. We found this new approach leads to a substantial improvement in the sensitivity and specificity of lesion detection and segmentation.},

The consequences of small vessel disease on the brain parenchyma are mainly lesions located in the subcortical structures such as lacunar infarcts, white matter lesions, large haemorrhages, and microbleeds. Because lacunar infarcts and white matter lesions are easily detected by neuroimaging, whereas small vessels are not, the term small vessel disease is frequently used to describe the parenchyma lesions rather than the underlying small vessel alterations. This classification, however, restricts the definition of small vessel disease to ischaemic lesions and might be misleading. Small vessel disease has an important role in cerebrovascular disease and is a leading cause of cognitive decline and functional loss in the elderly. Small vessel disease should be a main target for preventive and treatment strategies, but all types of presentation and complications should be taken into account.},

This task is very time-consuming and subject to intra- and inter-rater variability. In this paper, we present a new tool for automated MS lesion segmentation using T1w and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. METHODS: Our approach is based on two main steps, initial brain tissue segmentation according to the gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) performed in T1w images, followed by a second step where the lesions are segmented as outliers to the normal apparent GM brain tissue on the FLAIR image. RESULTS: The tool has been validated using data from more than 100 MS patients acquired with different scanners and at different magnetic field strengths. Quantitative evaluation provided a better performance in terms of precision while maintaining similar results on sensitivity and Dice similarity measures compared with those of other approaches. CONCLUSION: Our tool is implemented as a publicly available SPM8/12 extension that can be used by both the medical and research communities.},

  abstract      = {At its simplest, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) involves a voxel-wise comparison of the local concentration of gray matter between two groups of subjects. The procedure is relatively straightforward and involves spatially normalizing high-resolution images from all the subjects in the study into the same stereotactic space. This is followed by segmenting the gray matter from the spatially normalized images and smoothing the gray-matter segments. Voxel-wise parametric statistical tests which compare the smoothed gray-matter images from the two groups are performed. Corrections for multiple comparisons are made using the theory of Gaussian random fields. This paper describes the steps involved in VBM, with particular emphasis on segmenting gray matter from MR images with nonuniformity artifact. We provide evaluations of the assumptions that underpin the method, including the accuracy of the segmentation and the assumptions made about the statistical distribution of the data.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE Multi-sequence magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a frequently used method for characterising and quantifying white matter (WM) lesions in the human brain. The number and size of lesions are commonly determined to assess the diseases in clinical settings. Accurate WM lesion segmentation is very important for disease diagnosis and progression surveillance. The goal of this paper is to present an approach for improving WM lesion segmentation accuracy. METHODS In this paper, we propose a novel method integrating the multi-sequence and spatial information in a Bayesian framework for WM lesion detection from multi-sequence human brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs). The entire framework is based on a three-step approach: First, a multinomial logistic regression (MLR) algorithm is used to assess the conditional probability distributions of intensities in WM lesions and brain tissues from training data. Second, the spatial information previously given by a Markov random field (MRF) prior is integrated with multimodal information in the Bayesian framework to strengthen the spatial constraint. This step is especially effective when WM lesions have intensity values similar to those of other brain tissues. Finally, a post-processing step based on biological knowledge is used to remove some false positives. RESULTS Our method is validated using two datasets. The experimental results show that our algorithm agrees well with manual expert labelling and indicate that our multimodal spatial-based method offers a significant advantage over other approaches. CONCLUSIONS A three-step approach for combining multimodal and spatial information is proposed for WM lesion segmentation. The advantages of this approach are discussed, and a practical application to two datasets is presented.},

Multichannel magnetic resonance images are used to delineate multiple sclerosis lesions while segmenting the brain into its major structures.

An advantage of this approach is that all segmented structures are topologically constrained, thereby allowing subsequent processing such as cortical unfolding or diffeomorphic shape analysis techniques.

Described as nonparametric nonuniform intensity normalization (N3), the method is independent of pulse sequence and insensitive to pathological data that might otherwise violate model assumptions. To eliminate the dependence of the field estimate on anatomy, an iterative approach is employed to estimate both the multiplicative bias field and the distribution of the true tissue intensities.

  abstract = {Background: A meta-analysis of randomised trials in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis published in 2009 showed a quantitative relation between the treatment effects detected on MRI lesions and clinical relapses. We aimed to validate that relation using data from a large and independent set of clinical trials in multiple sclerosis. Methods: We searched Medline for clinical trials that assessed disease-modifying drugs for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis published from Sept 1, 2008, to Oct 31, 2012. We extracted data for the treatment effects on MRI lesions and on relapses from each trial, and the correlation of log transformed relative measures of these treatment effects was assessed with a weighted linear regression analysis. The R2 value was estimated to quantify the strength of the correlation, and we used an interaction test to test for a difference in slope from the previously estimated equation. We also ran several sensitivity analyses. Findings: We identified 31 eligible trials, which provided data for 18 901 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The regression equation derived using data from these studies showed a relation between the concurrent treatment effects on MRI lesions and relapses (slope = 0??52; R2 = 0??71), much the same as was previously estimated (pinteraction = 0??45). Analysis of trials that tested the same drugs in phase 2 and phase 3 studies showed that the effects on MRI lesions over short follow-up periods (6-9 months) can also predict the effects on relapses over longer follow-up periods (12-24 months), with reported effects on relapses that were within the 95{\%} prediction intervals in eight of nine trials. Interpretation: Our findings indicate that the effect of a treatment on relapses can be accurately predicted by the effect of that therapy on MRI lesions, implying that the use of MRI markers as primary endpoints in future clinical trials of treatments for multiple sclerosis can be considered, in specific situations, such as in trials testing generics or biosimilars of drugs with a well known mechanism of action or in paediatric trials testing drugs already approved for adults.

  abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease with profound heterogeneity in clinical course, neuroradiological appearance of the lesions, involvement of susceptibility gene loci, and response to therapy. These features are supported by experimental evidence, which demonstrates that fundamentally different processes, such as autoimmunity or virus infection, may induce MS-like inflammatory demyelinating plaques and suggest that MS may be a disease with heterogeneous pathogenetic mechanisms. From a large pathology sample of MS, collected in three international centers, we selected 51 biopsies and 32 autopsies that contained actively demyelinating lesions defined by stringent criteria. The pathology of the lesions was analyzed using a broad spectrum of immunological and neurobiological markers. Four fundamentally different patterns of demyelination were found, defined on the basis of myelin protein loss, the geography and extension of plaques, the patterns of oligodendrocyte destruction, and the immunopathological evidence of complement activation. Two patterns (I and II) showed close similarities to T-cell-mediated or T-cell plus antibody-mediated autoimmune encephalomyelitis, respectively. The other patterns (III and IV) were highly suggestive of a primary oligodendrocyte dystrophy, reminiscent of virus- or toxin-induced demyelination rather than autoimmunity. At a given time point of the disease--as reflected in autopsy cases--the patterns of demyelination were heterogeneous between patients, but were homogenous within multiple active lesions from the same patient. This pathogenetic heterogeneity of plaques from different MS patients may have fundamental implications for the diagnosis and therapy of this disease.},

In this case it is common to arrange the cross-validation procedure in a way that takes the source structure into account. Although common in practice, this procedure does not appear to have been theoretically analysed. We present new estimators of the variance of the cross-validation, both in the multiple-source setting and in the standard iid setting.

In order to minimize the false lesion classifications, a strategy that combines parametric and nonparametric techniques is developed and implemented. This approach uses the information from the proton density (PD)- and T2-weighted and fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. This strategy involves CSF and lesion classification using the Parzen window classifier. Image processing, morphological operations, and ratio maps of PD- and T2-weighted images are used for minimizing false positives. Contextual information is exploited for minimizing the false negative lesion classifications using hidden Markov random field-expectation maximization (HMRF-EM) algorithm. Lesions are delineated using fuzzy connectivity. The performance of this algorithm is quantitatively evaluated on 23 MS patients. Similarity index, percentages of over, under, and correct estimations of lesions are computed by spatially comparing the results of present procedure with expert manual segmentation. The automated processing scheme detected 80{\%} of the manually segmented lesions in the case of low lesion load and 93{\%} of the lesions in those cases with high lesion load.},

A two-step postprocessing method is proposed for standardizing the intensity scale in such a way that for the same MR protocol and body region, similar intensities will have similar tissue meaning. In the first step, the parameters of the standardizing transformation are "learned" from a set of images. In the second step, for each MR study these parameters are used to map their histogram into the standardized histogram. The method was tested quantitatively on 90 whole-brain studies of multiple sclerosis patients for several protocols and qualitatively for several other protocols and body regions. Measurements using mean squared difference showed that the standardized image intensities have statistically significantly (P {\textless} 0.01) more consistent range and meaning than the originals. Fixed gray level windows can be established for the standardized images and used for display without the need of per case adjustment. Preliminary results also indicate that the method facilitates improving the degree of automation of image segmentation. Magn Reson Med 42:1072-1081, 1999.},

  abstract = {The quantitative analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data has become increasingly important in both research and clinical studies aiming at human brain development, function, and pathology. Inevitably, the role of quantitative image analysis in the evaluation of drug therapy will increase, driven in part by requirements imposed by regulatory agencies. However, the prohibitive length of time involved and the significant intraand inter-rater variability of the measurements obtained from manual analysis of large MRI databases represent major obstacles to the wider application of quantitative MRI analysis. We have developed a fully automatic "pipeline" image analysis framework and have successfully applied it to a number of large-scale, multicenter studies (more than 1,000 MRI scans). This pipeline system is based on robust image processing algorithms, executed in a parallel, distributed fashion. This paper describes the application of this system to the automatic quantification of multiple sclerosis lesion load in MRI, in the context of a phase III clinical trial. The pipeline results were evaluated through an extensive validation study, revealing that the obtained lesion measurements are statistically indistinguishable from those obtained by trained human observers. Given that intra- and inter-rater measurement variability is eliminated by automatic analysis, this system enhances the ability to detect small treatment effects not readily detectable through conventional analysis techniques. While useful for clinical trial analysis in multiple sclerosis, this system holds widespread potential for applications in other neurological disorders, as well as for the study of neurobiology in general.},

Studies have established that extensive leukoaraiosis predicts dementia and disability, but the pathogenesis of leukoaraiosis remains unclear. We recruited 5 patients with leukoaraiosis and performed magnetic resonance mapping of the brain for 16 consecutive weeks. We observed tiny lesions arising de novo in the cerebral white matter. These lesions were clinically silent. They had the signature features of acute ischemic stroke. With time, the characteristics of these lesions approached those of pre-existing leukoaraiosis. Together, these findings suggest that tiny silent acute infarcts are a cause of leukoaraiosis.},

  abstract  = {Objectives Dementia is foremost a clinical diagnosis. However, in diagnosing dementia, it is advocated to perform at least one neuroimaging study. This has two purposes: to rule out potential reversible dementia (PRD), and to help determine the dementia subtype. Our first goal was to establish if MRI combined with visual rating scales changes the clinical diagnosis. The second goal was to demonstrate if MRI contributes to a geriatrician's confidence in the diagnosis. Methods The dementia subtype was determined prior to and after MRI. Scoring scales used were: global cortical atrophy (GCA), medial temporal atrophy (MTA), and white matter hyperintensity measured according to the Fazekas scale. The confidence level of the geriatrician was determined using a visual analogue scale. Results One hundred and thirty-five patients were included. After MRI, the diagnosis changed in 23.7 {\%} (CI 17.0 {\%}-31.1 {\%}) of patients. Change was due to vascular aetiology in 13.3 {\%} of patients. PRD was found in 2.2 {\%} of all patients. The confidence level in the diagnosis increased significantly after MRI (p = 0.001). Conclusions MRI, combined with visual rating scales, has a significant impact on dementia subtype diagnosis and on a geriatrician's confidence in the final diagnosis. Key points • MRI with visual rating scales changes the dementia subtype diagnosis significantly. • MRI is essential in demonstrating vascular disease as a cause of dementia. • All suspected dementia patients should undergo an MRI with visual rating scales. • MRI improves a geriatrician's confidence in the diagnosis of the dementia subtype. • MRI remains essential during the workup of dementia to exclude reversible causes.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The segmentation and volumetric quantification of white matter (WM) lesions play an important role in monitoring and studying neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or cerebrovascular disease. This is often interactively done using 2D magnetic resonance images. Recent developments in acquisition techniques allow for 3D imaging with much thinner sections, but the large number of images per subject makes manual lesion outlining infeasible. This warrants the need for a reliable automated approach. Here we aimed to improve k nearest neighbor (kNN) classification of WM lesions by optimizing intensity normalization and using spatial tissue type priors (TTPs).
  
  METHODS: The kNN-TTP method used kNN classification with 3.0 T 3DFLAIR and 3DT1 intensities as well as MNI-normalized spatial coordinates as features. Additionally, TTPs were computed by nonlinear registration of data from healthy controls. Intensity features were normalized using variance scaling, robust range normalization or histogram matching. The algorithm was then trained and evaluated using a leave-one-out experiment among 20 patients with MS against a reference segmentation that was created completely manually. The performance of each normalization method was evaluated both with and without TTPs in the feature set. Volumetric agreement was evaluated using intra-class coefficient (ICC), and voxelwise spatial agreement was evaluated using Dice similarity index (SI). Finally, the robustness of the method across different scanners and patient populations was evaluated using an independent sample of elderly subjects with hypertension.
  
  RESULTS: The intensity normalization method had a large influence on the segmentation performance, with average SI values ranging from 0.66 to 0.72 when no TTPs were used. Independent of the normalization method, the inclusion of TTPs as features increased performance particularly by reducing the lesion detection error. Best performance was achieved using variance scaled intensity features and including TTPs in the feature set: this yielded ICC = 0.93 and average SI = 0.75 ± 0.08. Validation of the method in an independent sample of elderly subjects with hypertension, yielded even higher ICC = 0.96 and SI = 0.84 ± 0.14.
  
  CONCLUSION: Adding TTPs increases the performance of kNN based MS lesion segmentation methods. Best performance was achieved using variance scaling for intensity normalization and including TTPs in the feature set, showing excellent agreement with the reference segmentations across a wide range of lesion severity, irrespective of the scanner used or the pathological substrate of the lesions.},

The number and volume of lesions have been used to evaluate MS disease burden, to track the progression of the disease and to evaluate the effect of new pharmaceuticals in clinical trials. Accurate identification of MS lesions in MR images is extremely difficult due to variability in lesion location, size and shape in addition to anatomical variability between subjects. Since manual segmentation requires expert knowledge, is time consuming and is subject to intra- and inter-expert variability, many methods have been proposed to automatically segment lesions. The objective of this study was to carry out a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the state of the art in automated multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation. From 1240 hits found initially with PubMed and Google scholar, our selection criteria identified 80 papers that described an automatic lesion segmentation procedure applied to MS. Only 47 of these included quantitative validation with at least one realistic image. In this paper, we describe the complexity of lesion segmentation, classify the automatic MS lesion segmentation methods found, and review the validation methods applied in each of the papers reviewed. Although many segmentation solutions have been proposed, including some with promising results using MRI data obtained on small groups of patients, no single method is widely employed due to performance issues related to the high variability of MS lesion appearance and differences in image acquisition. The challenge remains to provide segmentation techniques that work in all cases regardless of the type of MS, duration of the disease, or MRI protocol, and this within a comprehensive, standardized validation framework. MS lesion segmentation remains an open problem.},

  abstract = {Accurate classification and quantification of brain tissues is important for monitoring disease progression, measurement of atrophy, and correlating magnetic resonance (MR) measures with clinical disability. Classification of MR brain images in the presence of lesions, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), is particularly challenging. Images obtained with lower resolution often suffer from partial volume averaging leading to false classifications. While partial volume averaging can be reduced by acquiring volumetric images at high resolution, image segmentation and quantification can be technically challenging. In this study, we integrated the brain anatomical knowledge with non-parametric and parametric statistical classifiers for automatically classifying tissues and lesions on high resolution multichannel three-dimensional images acquired on 60 MS brains. The results of automatic lesion segmentation were reviewed by the expert. The agreement between results obtained by the automated analysis and the expert was excellent as assessed by the quantitative metrics, low absolute volume difference percent (36.18±34.90), low average symmetric surface distance (1.64mm±1.30mm), high true positive rate (84.75±12.69), and low false positive rate (34.10±16.00). The segmented results were also in close agreement with the corrected results as assessed by Bland–Altman and regression analyses. Finally, our lesion segmentation was validated using the MS lesion segmentation grand challenge dataset (MICCAI 2008).},

Currently, white matter lesions are divided into periventricular white matter lesions and deep white matter lesions. Although the meaning of these terms varies by study and this dichotomization itself is still in debate, a possible dissimilarity in pathogenic mechanisms between periventricular white matter lesions and deep white matter lesions are providing some clues for understanding pathophysiology of many geriatric syndromes associated with white matter lesions. We have reviewed the distinctions between periventricular white matter lesions and deep white matter lesions in terms of etiology, histopathology, functional correlates, and imaging methodologies. We suggest a new subclassification of white matter lesions that might have better etiological and functional relevance than the current simple dichotomization. The new categories are juxtaventricular, periventricular, deep white, and juxtacortical. This new classification scheme might contribute to reducing the heterogeneity of white matter lesion findings in future research. ?? 2008 Society of Biological Psychiatry.},

  abstract      = {The NINCDS-ADRDA and the DSM-IV-TR criteria for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the prevailing diagnostic standards in research; however, they have now fallen behind the unprecedented growth of scientific knowledge. Distinctive and reliable biomarkers of AD are now available through structural MRI, molecular neuroimaging with PET, and cerebrospinal fluid analyses. This progress provides the impetus for our proposal of revised diagnostic criteria for AD. Our framework was developed to capture both the earliest stages, before full-blown dementia, as well as the full spectrum of the illness. These new criteria are centred on a clinical core of early and significant episodic memory impairment. They stipulate that there must also be at least one or more abnormal biomarkers among structural neuroimaging with MRI, molecular neuroimaging with PET, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis of amyloid $\beta$ or tau proteins. The timeliness of these criteria is highlighted by the many drugs in development that are directed at changing pathogenesis, particularly at the production and clearance of amyloid $\beta$ as well as at the hyperphosphorylation state of tau. Validation studies in existing and prospective cohorts are needed to advance these criteria and optimise their sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Between observer overlap ratio was 63{\%}. Using our previously described in-house software, we had overlap of 62.2{\%}. We investigated the use of a modified version of SPM segmentation; however, this was not successful, with only 14{\%} overlap. Discussion.

  abstract = {In applied statistics regression models with high-dimensional coefficients can occur which cannot be estimated using ordinary computers. Amongst others, this applies to the analysis of digital images taking spatio-temporal dependencies into account as they commonly occur within bio-medical research. In this thesis a procedure is formulated which allows to fit regression models with high-dimensional coefficients and non-normal response values requiring only moderate computational equipment. To this end, limitations of different inference strategies for structured additive regression models are demonstrated when applied to high-dimensional problems and possible solutions are discussed. Based thereon an algorithm is formulated whose strengths and weaknesses are subsequently analyzed using simulation studies. Furthermore, the procedure is applied to three different fields of bio-medical imaging from which can be concluded that the algorithm is a promising candidate for answering high-dimensional problems.},

  abstract  = {Clinical MRI depends on a symbiosis between MR physics and clinical requirements. The imaging solutions are based on a balance between the "palette" of available image contrasts derived from nuclear spin physics and tissue biophysics, and clinical determinants such as the anticipated pathology and efficient use of imaging time. Imaging is therefore optimized to maximize diagnostic sensitivity and specificity through the development of protocols organized along the lines of major disease categories. In the other part of this two-part review, the primary determinants of image contrast, including T1, T2, and T2*, were highlighted. The development of pulse sequences designed to optimize each of these image contrasts was discussed and the impact of technological innovation (parallel imaging and high-field systems) on the manner in which these sequences could be modified to improve clinical efficacy was further emphasized. The scope of that discussion was broadened to include the application of: 1) water diffusion imaging used primarily for detection of pathologies that restrict the free movement of water in the tissues and for defining fiber tracts in the brain; 2) the intravenous administration of exogenous contrast agents (gadolinium-diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid [GdDTPA]) for assessment of blood-brain-barrier (BBB) defects and brain blood flow; and 3) MR spectroscopy (MRS) for assessment of brain metabolites. The goal of this part is to discuss how these acquisitions are combined into specific protocols that can effectively detect and characterize, or in keeping with our artistic analogy, "paint" each of the major diseases affecting the central nervous system (CNS). This work concludes with a discussion of image artifacts and pitfalls in image interpretation, which, in spite our best efforts to minimize or eliminate them, continue to occur. Much of the ensuing discussion is based on our own institutional experience. Protocols, therefore, do not necessarily match those from other institutions due to variability in clinical emphasis, MR instruments, and available software. An attempt was made to focus on basic clinical sequences that are available on most modern MR systems, with protocols employing generally accepted clinical imaging philosophies.},

Global grey matter volume decreased linearly with age, with a significantly steeper decline in males. Local areas of accelerated loss were observed bilaterally in the insula, superior parietal gyri, central sulci, and cingulate sulci. Areas exhibiting little or no age effect (relative preservation) were noted in the amygdala, hippocampi, and entorhinal cortex. Global white matter did not decline with age, but local areas of relative accelerated loss and preservation were seen. There was no interaction of age with sex for regionally specific effects. These results corroborate previous reports and indicate that VBM is a useful technique for studying structural brain correlates of ageing through life in humans.},

The resulting GM segmentation is used to automatically find a white matter lesion (WML) threshold in a fluid-attenuated inversion recovery scan. False positive lesions are removed by ensuring that the lesions are within the white matter. The method was visually validated on a set of 209 subjects. No segmentation errors were found in 98{\%} of the brain tissue segmentations and 97{\%} of the WML segmentations. A quantitative evaluation using manual segmentations was performed on a subset of 6 subjects for CSF, GM and WM segmentation and an additional 14 for the WML segmentations. The results indicated that the automatic segmentation accuracy is close to the interobserver variability of manual segmentations.},

We analyze the accuracy of gray and white matter volume measurements and their robustness against changes of image quality using the BrainWeb MRI database. These images are based on "gold-standard" reference brain templates. This allows us to assess between- (same data set, different method) and also within-segmenter (same method, variation of image quality) comparability, for both of which we find pronounced variations in segmentation results for gray and white matter volumes. The calculated volumes deviate up to {\textgreater}10{\%} from the reference values for gray and white matter depending on method and image quality. Sensitivity is best for SPM5, volumetric accuracy for gray and white matter was similar in SPM5 and FSL and better than in FreeSurfer. FSL showed the highest stability for white ({\textless}5{\%}), FreeSurfer (6.2{\%}) for gray matter for constant image quality BrainWeb data. Between-segmenter comparisons show discrepancies of up to {\textgreater}20{\%} for the simulated data and 24{\%} on average for the real data sets, whereas within-method performance analysis uncovered volume differences of up to {\textgreater}15{\%}. Since the discrepancies between results reach the same order of magnitude as volume changes observed in disease, these effects limit the usability of the segmentation methods for following volume changes in individual patients over time and should be taken into account during the planning and analysis of brain volume studies.},

We investigated the relationship between SVD, multiple isoforms of A$\beta$ in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cortical A$\beta$ in 831 subjects with cognitive performance ranging from normal to Alzheimer's disease (AD) (the Swedish BioFINDER study). SVD was estimated as white matter lesions (WML) and lacunes. 18F-flutemetamol PET was performed in 321 subjects. Lower CSF levels of A$\beta$38 and A$\beta$40 were consistently associated with increased WML in all subgroups, while lower levels of CSF A$\beta$42 were associated with WML mainly in AD. CSF A$\beta$38 and A$\beta$40 were associated with regional WML in all regions, while CSF A$\beta$42 was associated with temporal WML only. A composite measure of 18F-flutemetamol uptake was not associated with WML, and regional 18F-flutemetamol uptake only with temporal WML. Lacunes were not associated with A$\beta$ isoforms nor 18F-flutemetamol uptake. Our results suggest that WML may be associated with alterations in the production or clearance of A$\beta$ species, particularly of A$\beta$38 and A$\beta$40. However, in AD cases, A$\beta$42 pathology might be associated with WML, especially in the temporal lobe.},

Edge based segmentation methods suffer from spurious edges and gaps in boundaries. A multiscale method to MRI brain segmentation is presented which uses both edge and intensity information. First a multiscale representation of an image is created, which can be made edge dependent to favor intra-tissue diffusion over inter-tissue diffusion. Subsequently a multiscale linking model (the hyperstack) is used to group voxels into a number of objects based on intensity. It is shown that both an improvement in accuracy and a reduction in image post-processing can be achieved if edge dependent diffusion is used instead of linear diffusion. The combination of edge dependent diffusion and intensity based linking facilitates segmentation of grey matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid with minimal user interaction. To segment the total brain (white matter plus grey matter) morphological operations are applied to remove small bridges between the brain and cranium. If the total brain is segmented, grey matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid can be segmented by joining a small number of segments. Using a supervised segmentation technique and MRI simulations of a brain phantom for validation it is shown that the errors are in the order of or smaller than reported in literature.},

  abstract = {Vascular dysfunction has a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent data from brain imaging studies in humans and animal models suggest that cerebrovascular dysfunction may precede cognitive decline and onset of neurodegenerative changes in AD and AD models. Cerebral hypoperfusion and impaired amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) clearance across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may contribute to the onset and progression of dementia AD type. Decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) negatively affects the synthesis of proteins required for memory and learning, and may eventually lead to neuritic injury and neuronal death. Impaired clearance of Abeta from the brain by the cells of the neurovascular unit may lead to its accumulation on blood vessels and in brain parenchyma. The accumulation of Abeta on the cerebral blood vessels, known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), is associated with cognitive decline and is one of the hallmarks of AD pathology. CAA can severely disrupt the integrity of the blood vessel wall resulting in micro or macro intracerebral bleedings that exacerbates neurodegenerative process and inflammatory response and may lead to hemorrhagic stroke, respectively. Here, we review the role of the neurovascular unit and molecular mechanisms in vascular cells behind AD and CAA pathogenesis. First, we discuss apparent vascular changes, including the cerebral hypoperfusion and vascular degeneration that contribute to different stages of the disease process in AD individuals. We next discuss the role of the low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 (LRP), a key Abeta clearance receptor at the BBB and along the cerebrovascular system, whose expression is suppressed early in AD. We also discuss how brain-derived apolipoprotein E isoforms may influence Abeta clearance across the BBB. We then review the role of two interacting transcription factors, myocardin and serum response factor, in cerebral vascular cells in controlling CBF responses and LRP-mediated Abeta clearance. Finally, we discuss the role of microglia and perivascular macrophages in Abeta clearance from the brain. The data reviewed here support an essential role of neurovascular and BBB mechanisms in contributing to both, onset and progression of AD.},

  abstract = {An automated method for segmenting magnetic resonance head images into brain and non-brain has been developed. It is very robust and accurate and has been tested on thousands of data sets from a wide variety of scanners and taken with a wide variety of MR sequences. The method, Brain Extraction Tool (BET), uses a deformable model that evolves to fit the brain's surface by the application of a set of locally adaptive model forces. The method is very fast and requires no preregistration or other pre-processing before being applied. We describe the new method and give examples of results and the results of extensive quantitative testing against "gold-standard" hand segmentations, and two other popular automated methods.},

Our contour detector combines multiple local cues into a globalization framework based on spectral clustering. Our segmentation algorithm consists of generic machinery for transforming the output of any contour detector into a hierarchical region tree. In this manner, we reduce the problem of image segmentation to that of contour detection. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that both our contour detection and segmentation methods significantly outperform competing algorithms. The automatically generated hierarchical segmentations can be interactively refined by user-specified annotations. Computation at multiple image resolutions provides a means of coupling our system to recognition applications.},

Our method uses a novel filter to enhance the intensity of WMLs. Then a feature set containing enhanced intensity, anatomical and spatial information is used to train a random forest classifier for the initial segmentation of WMLs. Following that a reliable and robust edge potential function based Markov Random Field (MRF) is proposed to obtain the final segmentation by removing false positive WMLs. Quantitative evaluation of the proposed method is performed on 24 subjects of ENVISion study. The segmentation results are validated against the manual segmentation, performed under the supervision of an expert neuroradiologist. The results show a dice similarity index of 0.76 for severe lesion load, 0.73 for moderate lesion load and 0.61 for mild lesion load. In addition to that we have compared our method with three state of the art methods on 20 subjects of Medical Image Computing and Computer Aided Intervention Society's (MICCAI's) MS lesion challenge dataset, where our method shows better segmentation accuracy compare to the state of the art methods. These results indicate that the proposed method can assist the neuroradiologists in assessing the WMLs in clinical practice.},

However, although detection of small structural brain differences may fundamentally depend on the method used, both accuracy and reliability of different automated segmentation algorithms have rarely been compared. Here, performance of the segmentation algorithms provided by SPM8, VBM8, FSL and FreeSurfer was quantified on simulated and real magnetic resonance imaging data. First, accuracy was assessed by comparing segmentations of twenty simulated and 18 real T1 images with corresponding ground truth images. Second, reliability was determined in ten T1 images from the same subject and in ten T1 images of different subjects scanned twice. Third, the impact of preprocessing steps on segmentation accuracy was investigated. VBM8 showed a very high accuracy and a very high reliability. FSL achieved the highest accuracy but demonstrated poor reliability and FreeSurfer showed the lowest accuracy, but high reliability. An universally valid recommendation on how to implement morphometric analyses is not warranted due to the vast number of scanning and analysis parameters. However, our analysis suggests that researchers can optimize their individual processing procedures with respect to final segmentation quality and exemplifies adequate performance criteria.},

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitatively evaluation of the generated samples.},

  abstract = {Reliable quantification of white matter hyperintensities of presumed vascular origin (WMHs) is increasingly needed, given the presence of these MRI findings in patients with several neurological and vascular disorders, as well as in elderly healthy subjects. We present BIANCA (Brain Intensity AbNormality Classification Algorithm), a fully automated, supervised method for WMH detection, based on the k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) algorithm. Relative to previous k-NN based segmentation methods, BIANCA offers different options for weighting the spatial information, local spatial intensity averaging, and different options for the choice of the number and location of the training points. BIANCA is multimodal and highly flexible so that the user can adapt the tool to their protocol and specific needs. We optimised and validated BIANCA on two datasets with different MRI protocols and patient populations (a “predominantly neurodegenerative” and a “predominantly vascular” cohort). BIANCA was first optimised on a subset of images for each dataset in terms of overlap and volumetric agreement with a manually segmented WMH mask. The correlation between the volumes extracted with BIANCA (using the optimised set of options), the volumes extracted from the manual masks and visual ratings showed that BIANCA is a valid alternative to manual segmentation. The optimised set of options was then applied to the whole cohorts and the resulting WMH volume estimates showed good correlations with visual ratings and with age. Finally, we performed a reproducibility test, to evaluate the robustness of BIANCA, and compared BIANCA performance against existing methods. Our findings suggest that BIANCA, which will be freely available as part of the FSL package, is a reliable method for automated WMH segmentation in large cross-sectional cohort studies.},

Here we tackled the problemof objectively comparing INU correction techniques for T1-weighted images, which are the most commonly used in structural brain imaging. We focused our investigations on the methods integrated in widely used software packages for MR data analysis: FreeSurfer, BrainVoyager, SPM and FSL. We used simulated data to assess the INU fields reconstructed by those methods for controlled inhomogeneity magnitudes and noise levels. For each method, we evaluated a wide range of input parameters and defined an enhanced configuration associated with best recon- struction performance. By comparing enhanced and default configurations, we found that the former often provide much more accurate results. Accordingly, we used enhanced configurations for a more objective comparison between methods. For different levels of INU magnitude and noise, SPM and FSL, which integrate INUcorrection with brain segmentation, generally outperformed FreeSurfer and BrainVoyager, whose methods are exclusively dedicated to INU correction. Nonetheless, accurate INU field reconstructions can be obtained with FreeSurfer on images with low noise and with BrainVoyager for slow and smooth inhomogeneity profiles. Our study may prove helpful for an accurate selection of the INUcorrection method to be used based on the characteristics of actual MR data.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: Accurate brain tissue segmentation from magnetic resonance (MR) images is an important step in analysis of cerebral images. There are software packages which are used for brain segmentation. These packages usually contain a set of skull stripping, intensity non-uniformity (bias) correction and segmentation routines. Thus, assessment of the quality of the segmented gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is needed for the neuroimaging applications. METHODS: In this paper, performance evaluation of three widely used brain segmentation software packages SPM8, FSL and Brainsuite is presented. Segmentation with SPM8 has been performed in three frameworks: i) default segmentation, ii) SPM8 New-segmentation and iii) modified version using hidden Markov random field as implemented in SPM8-VBM toolbox. RESULTS: The accuracy of the segmented GM, WM and CSF and the robustness of the tools against changes of image quality has been assessed using Brainweb simulated MR images and IBSR real MR images. The calculated similarity between the segmented tissues using different tools and corresponding ground truth shows variations in segmentation results. CONCLUSION: A few studies has investigated GM, WM and CSF segmentation. In these studies, the skull stripping and bias correction are performed separately and they just evaluated the segmentation. Thus, in this study, assessment of complete segmentation framework consisting of pre-processing and segmentation of these packages is performed. The obtained results can assist the users in choosing an appropriate segmentation software package for the neuroimaging application of interest.},

  abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation is crucial for evaluating disease burden, determining disease progression and measuring the impact of new clinical treatments. MS lesions can vary in size, location and intensity, making automatic segmentation challenging. In this paper, we propose a new supervised method to segment MS lesions from 3D magnetic resonance (MR) images using non-local means (NLM). The method uses a multi-channel and rotation-invariant distance measure to account for the diversity of MS lesions. The proposed segmentation method, rotation-invariant multi-contrast non-local means segmentation (RMNMS), captures the MS lesion spatial distribution and can accurately and robustly identify lesions regardless of their orientation, shape or size. An internal validation on a large clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset of MS patients demonstrated a good similarity measure result (Dice similarity = 60.1{\%} and sensitivity = 75.4{\%}), a strong correlation between expert and automatic lesion load volumes (R2 = 0.91), and a strong ability to detect lesions of different sizes and in varying spatial locations (lesion detection rate = 79.8{\%}). On the independent MS Grand Challenge (MSGC) dataset validation, our method provided competitive results with state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods. Qualitative visual and quantitative voxel- and lesion-wise evaluations demonstrated the accuracy of RMNMS method.},

  abstract  = {An artifact found in magnetic resonance images (MRI) called partial volume averaging (PVA) has received much attention since accurate segmentation of cerebral anatomy and pathology is impeded by this artifact. Traditional neurological segmentation techniques rely on Gaussian mixture models to handle noise and PVA, or high-dimensional feature sets that exploit redundancy in multispectral datasets. Unfortunately, model-based techniques may not be optimal for images with non-Gaussian noise distributions and/or pathology, and multispectral techniques model probabilities instead of the partial volume (PV) fraction. For robust segmentation, a PV fraction estimation approach is developed for cerebral MRI that does not depend on predetermined intensity distribution models or multispectral scans. Instead, the PV fraction is estimated directly from each image using an adaptively defined global edge map constructed by exploiting a relationship between edge content and PVA. The final PVA map is used to segment anatomy and pathology with subvoxel accuracy. Validation on simulated and real, pathology-free T1 MRI (Gaussian noise), as well as pathological fluid attenuation inversion recovery MRI (non-Gaussian noise), demonstrate that the PV fraction is accurately estimated and the resultant segmentation is robust. Comparison to model-based methods further highlight the benefits of the current approach.},

Regularisation of the field is based on membrane energy. At present the registration is based on a weighted sum of scaled sum-of-squared differences and mebrane energy. Great effort has been placed on the optimisation, and on providing computational tools to enable robust and rapid convergence even for relatively high resolution of the warps. The results that are presented are based on a multi-scale Levenberg-Marquardt minimisation. The registration is initialised and run to convergence with sub-sampled images, a field of low resolution and a high regularisation weight. The images and the fields from the first step are then up-sampled, the regularisation modified and it is again run to convergence. This is repeated until the required warp-resolution and level of regularisation is achieved. The method has been tested with promising results on T1-weighted structural images and on FA-images from DTI acqusitions.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses a white matter lesion (WML) segmentation scheme for fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI. The method computes the volume of lesions with subvoxel precision by accounting for the partial volume averaging (PVA) artifact. As WMLs are related to stroke and carotid disease, accurate volume measurements are most important. Manual volume computation is laborious, subjective, time consuming, and error prone. Automated methods are a nice alternative since they quantify WML volumes in an objective, efficient, and reliable manner. PVA is initially modeled with a localized edge strength measure since PVA resides in the boundaries between tissues. This map is computed in 3-D and is transformed to a global representation to increase robustness to noise. Significant edges correspond to PVA voxels, which are used to find the PVA fraction alpha (amount of each tissue present in mixture voxels). Results on simulated and real FLAIR images show high WML segmentation performance compared to ground truth (98.9{\%} and 83{\%} overlap, respectively), which outperforms other methods. Lesion load studies are included that automatically analyze WML volumes for each brain hemisphere separately. This technique does not require any distributional assumptions/parameters or training samples and is applied on a single MR modality, which is a major advantage compared to the traditional methods.},

The authors then generated a series of statistical measures which express this population nonlinear variability in the form of parametric volumes, e.g. mean intensity, intensity variance.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This study aims to develop an automatic segmentation framework on the basis of extreme value distribution (EVD) for the detection and volumetric quantification of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. METHODS: Two EVD-based segmentation methods, namely the Gumbel and Frechet segmentation, were developed to detect WMHs on FLAIR (slice thickness = 5 mm; TR/TE/TI = 11,000/120/2,800 ms; flip angle = 90 degrees ) images. Another automatic segmentation method using a trimmed likelihood estimator (TLE) was implemented for comparison with our proposed segmentation framework. The performances of the three automatic segmentation methods were evaluated by comparing with the manual segmentation method. RESULTS: The Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) of the two EVD-based segmentation methods were larger than those of the TLE-based segmentation method (Gumbel, 0.823 +/- 0.063; Frechet, 0.843 +/- 0.057; TLE, 0.817 +/- 0.068), demonstrating that the EVD-based segmentation outperformed the TLE-based segmentation. The Frechet segmentation obtained larger DSCs on patients with moderate to severe lesion loads and a comparable performance on patients with mild lesion loads, indicating that the Frechet segmentation was superior to the Gumbel segmentation. The Gumbel segmentation underestimated the lesion volumes of all patients, whereas the Frechet and TLE-based segmentation methods obtained overestimated lesion volumes (Manual, 13.71 +/- 14.02 cc; Gumbel, 12.73 +/- 13.21 cc; Frechet, 13.88 +/- 13.96 cc; TLE, 13.54 +/- 12.27 cc). Moreover, the EVD-based segmentation was demonstrated to be comparable to other state-of-the-art methods on a publicly available dataset. CONCLUSION: The proposed EVD-based segmentation framework is a promising, effective, and convenient tool for volumetric quantification and further study of WMHs in aging and dementia.},

  abstract  = {A novel procedure is proposed to extract T1, T2, and relative spin density from the signal time course sampled with a series of TrueFISP images after spin inversion. Generally, the recovery of the magnetization during continuous TrueFISP imaging can be described in good approximation by a three parameter monoexponential function S(t) = S stst(1-INV exp(-t/T1*). This apparent relaxation time T1* ≤ T1 depends on the flip angle as well as on both T1 and T2. Here, it is shown that the ratio T1/T2 can be directly extracted from the inversion factor INV, which describes the relation of the signal value extrapolated to t = 0 and the steady-state signal. Analytical expressions are given for the derivation of T1, T2, and relative spin density directly from the fit parameters. Phantom results show excellent agreement with single point reference measurements. In human volunteers T1, T2, and spin density maps in agreement with literature values were obtained. {\textcopyright} 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Although the individual concepts are simple, there are many concepts to learn and retain simultaneously; this situation may give the illusion that learning the physics of MR imaging is complicated. It is important for the radiologist who interprets MR images to understand the methods used to create the images because image contrast specifically depends on how the image data were acquired. Initial concepts include formation of magnetic fields from electric currents in loops of wire, the resonance phenomenon, the hydrogen proton and its frequency of precession, and absorption of radiofrequency energy. These concepts can then be applied to learn about T1 and T2 relaxation and contrast and how the acquisition parameters of echo time and repetition time can be used to achieve these image contrasts. Basic pulse sequences include the spin-echo, multiecho spin-echo, turbo spin-echo, inversion-recovery, and gradient-recalled-echo sequences.},

We model the topological properties of the lesions and brain tissues in order to constrain the lesion segmentation to the white matter. As a result, the method is independent of an MRI atlas. We tested our method on the MICCAI MS grand challenge proposed in 2008 and achieved competitive results. In addition, we used an in-house dataset of 15 MS patients, for which we achieved best results in most distances in comparison to atlas based methods. Besides classical segmentation distances, we motivate and formulate a new distance to evaluate the quality of the lesion segmentation, while being robust with respect to minor inconsistencies at the boundary level of the ground truth annotation.},

In this work, a fast, FLAIR-only lesion segmentation algorithm is proposed, that does not use tissue priors or parametric models. The method uses an edge-based model of partial volume averaging to estimate fuzzy membership profiles of tissue classes. Results are further refined using an upstream image standardization pipeline, and downstream post processing. Lesion segmentation performance is measured on 15 volumes from three different scanners, demonstrating the robustness of the approach.},

This article introduces the basic concept of ICC in the content of reliability analysis. Discussion for Researchers There are 10 forms of ICCs. Because each form involves distinct assumptions in their calculation and will lead to different interpretations, researchers should explicitly specify the ICC form they used in their calculation. A thorough review of the research design is needed in selecting the appropriate form of ICC to evaluate reliability. The best practice of reporting ICC should include software information, ???model,??? ???type,??? and ???definition??? selections. Discussion for Readers When coming across an article that includes ICC, readers should first check whether information about the ICC form has been reported and if an appropriate ICC form was used. Based on the 95{\%} confident interval of the ICC estimate, values less than 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and greater than 0.90 are indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability, respectively. Conclusion This article provides a practical guideline for clinical researchers to choose the correct form of ICC and suggests the best practice of reporting ICC parameters in scientific publications. This article also gives readers an appreciation for what to look for when coming across ICC while reading an article.},

  abstract = {White matter hyperintensities (WMH) on T2 or FLAIR sequences have been commonly observed on MR images of elderly people. They have been associated with various disorders and have been shown to be a strong risk factor for stroke and dementia. WMH studies usually required visual evaluation of WMH load or time-consuming manual delineation. This paper introduced WHASA (White matter Hyperintensities Automated Segmentation Algorithm), a new method for automatically segmenting WMH from FLAIR and T1 images in multicentre studies. Contrary to previous approaches that were based on intensities, this method relied on contrast: non linear diffusion filtering alternated with watershed segmentation to obtain piecewise constant images with increased contrast between WMH and surroundings tissues. WMH were then selected based on subject dependant automatically computed threshold and anatomical information. WHASA was evaluated on 67 patients from two studies, acquired on six different MRI scanners and displaying a wide range of lesion load. Accuracy of the segmentation was assessed through volume and spatial agreement measures with respect to manual segmentation; an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.96 and a mean similarity index (SI) of 0.72 were obtained. WHASA was compared to four other approaches: Freesurfer and a thresholding approach as unsupervised methods; k-nearest neighbours (kNN) and support vector machines (SVM) as supervised ones. For these latter, influence of the training set was also investigated. WHASA clearly outperformed both unsupervised methods, while performing at least as good as supervised approaches (ICC range: 0.87-0.91 for kNN; 0.89-0.94 for SVM. Mean SI: 0.63-0.71 for kNN, 0.67-0.72 for SVM), and did not need any training set.},

  abstract = {Over the last few years, the increasing interest in brain tissue volume measurements on clinical settings has led to the development of a wide number of automated tissue segmentation methods. However, white matter lesions are known to reduce the performance of automated tissue segmentation methods, which requires manual annotation of the lesions and refilling them before segmentation, which is tedious and time-consuming. Here, we propose a new, fully automated T1-w/FLAIR tissue segmentation approach designed to deal with images in the presence of WM lesions. This approach integrates a robust partial volume tissue segmentation with WM outlier rejection and filling, combining intensity and probabilistic and morphological prior maps. We evaluate the performance of this method on the MRBrainS13 tissue segmentation challenge database, which contains images with vascular WM lesions, and also on a set of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patient images. On both databases, we validate the performance of our method with other state-of-the-art techniques. On the MRBrainS13 data, the presented approach was at the time of submission the best ranked unsupervised intensity model method of the challenge (7th position) and clearly outperformed the other unsupervised pipelines such as FAST and SPM12. On MS data, the differences in tissue segmentation between the images segmented with our method and the same images where manual expert annotations were used to refill lesions on T1-w images before segmentation were lower or similar to the best state-of-the-art pipeline incorporating automated lesion segmentation and filling. Our results show that the proposed pipeline achieved very competitive results on both vascular and MS lesions. A public version of this approach is available to download for the neuro-imaging community.},

The method makes use of local morphometric features based on multiple MR sequences, including T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and fluid attenuated inversion recovery. After preprocessing, including co-registration, brain extraction, bias correction, and intensity standardization, 49 features are calculated for each brain voxel based on local morphometry. At each level of segmentation a supervised classifier takes advantage of a different subset of the features to conservatively segment lesion voxels, passing on more difficult voxels to the next classifier. This multi-level approach allows for a fast lesion classification method with tunable trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity producing accuracy comparable to a human rater.},

This approach uses a step-by-step procedure, where the most obvious features in the images are identified first, and used to calibrate the application of the next step, until the desired features are identified. The approach stresses testing on a large number of images of the same type, and exploiting the special characteristics of this type of images. The system was designed with the variations of the various image parameters in mind, to ensure its reliability. New low-level methods of high reliability have been developed for segmenting images. A new geometric modeling method which tolerates the variability of biological structures is used to encode anatomic knowledge. The system and its components have been tested on 1132 images from 17 patients, with very good results. ?? 1990.},

Accurate and reproducible automatic segmentation of WMHs is important since WMHs are often seen in the elderly and are associated with various geriatric and psychiatric disorders.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We developed a fully automated monospectral segmentation method for WMHs using FLAIR MRIs. Through this method, we introduce an optimal threshold intensity (I O ) for segmenting WMHs, which varies with WMHs volume (V WMH), and we establish the I O -V WMH relationship.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Our method showed accurate validations in volumetric and spatial agreements of automatically segmented WMHs compared with manually segmented WMHs for 32 confirmatory images. Bland-Altman values of volumetric agreement were 0.96 ± 8.311 ml (bias and 95 {\%} confidence interval), and the similarity index of spatial agreement was 0.762 ± 0.127 (mean ± standard deviation). Furthermore, similar validation accuracies were obtained in the images acquired from different scanners.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The proposed segmentation method uses only FLAIR MRIs, has the potential to be accurate with images obtained from different scanners, and can be implemented with a fully automated procedure. In our study, validation results were obtained with FLAIR MRIs from only two scanner types. The design of the method may allow its use in large multicenter studies with correct efficiency.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare qualitatively and quantitatively the contrast of brain lesions detected with fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) and intermediate-weighted sequences at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective study, 47 patients suspected of having a brain lesion underwent MR imaging with FLAIR, intermediate-weighted, and T2-weighted sequences. Qualitative assessment was performed of lesion conspicuity, detection, overall image artifact, and additional clinical information. Contrast and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were calculated between lesions and the normal brain or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). RESULTS: FLAIR images were equal to intermediate-weighted images for overall lesion conspicuity and detection but were associated more often with image artifacts. Lesion-to-background contrast was significantly higher on FLAIR than on intermediate-weighted images. FLAIR images failed to demonstrate multiple sclerosis (MS) plaques located in the basal ganglia and brain stem. CONCLUSION: Although FLAIR images provided additional information in some cases, they did not have distinct advantages over intermediate-weighted images. When cases of MS are evaluated, intermediate-weighted images are preferable to FLAIR images. Except in cases of MS, either FLAIR or intermediate-weighted sequences should be added to T2-weighted sequences at MR imaging.},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to detect lesions in the brains of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and is essential for diagnosing the disease and monitoring its progression. In practice, lesion load is often quantified by either manual or semi-automated segmentation of MRI, which is time-consuming, costly, and associated with large inter- and intra-observer variability. We propose OASIS is Automated Statistical Inference for Segmentation (OASIS), an automated statistical method for segmenting MS lesions in MRI studies. We use logistic regression models incorporating multiple MRI modalities to estimate voxel-level probabilities of lesion presence. Intensity-normalized T1-weighted, T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and proton density volumes from 131 MRI studies (98 MS subjects, 33 healthy subjects) with manual lesion segmentations were used to train and validate our model. Within this set, OASIS detected lesions with a partial area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for clinically relevant false positive rates of 1{\%} and below of 0.59{\%} (95{\%} CI; [0.50{\%}, 0.67{\%}]) at the voxel level. An experienced MS neuroradiologist compared these segmentations to those produced by LesionTOADS, an image segmentation software that provides segmentation of both lesions and normal brain structures. For lesions, OASIS out-performed LesionTOADS in 74{\%} (95{\%} CI: [65{\%}, 82{\%}]) of cases for the 98 MS subjects. To further validate the method, we applied OASIS to 169 MRI studies acquired at a separate center. The neuroradiologist again compared the OASIS segmentations to those from LesionTOADS. For lesions, OASIS ranked higher than LesionTOADS in 77{\%} (95{\%} CI: [71{\%}, 83{\%}]) of cases. For a randomly selected subset of 50 of these studies, one additional radiologist and one neurologist also scored the images. Within this set, the neuroradiologist ranked OASIS higher than LesionTOADS in 76{\%} (95{\%} CI: [64{\%}, 88{\%}]) of cases, the neurologist 66{\%} (95{\%} CI: [52{\%}, 78{\%}]) and the radiologist 52{\%} (95{\%} CI: [38{\%}, 66{\%}]). OASIS obtains the estimated probability for each voxel to be part of a lesion by weighting each imaging modality with coefficient weights. These coefficients are explicit, obtained using standard model fitting techniques, and can be reused in other imaging studies. This fully automated method allows sensitive and specific detection of lesion presence and may be rapidly applied to large collections of images. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

  abstract  = {Histopathology gives the definitive diagnosis for many diseases, including breast cancer. Recent criticisms of manual histopathology image analysis have motivated quality assurance programs examining this modality. This chapter reviews the challenges associated with conventional histopathology workflows, with specific focus on inconsistencies in manual analysis. These challenges are then contrasted with the advantages of digital workflows, including better database management, ease of remote consultations, and the potential for automated analysis. The remainder of the chapter explores the design of an automated analysis algorithm for classifying breast cancer histological image samples as either benign or malignant. Three complex image features are designed with inspiration from the Nottingham Grading System used by pathologists for the same task. Such features discriminate the two classes well using simple classifiers (SVM and Bayes) under 3-fold cross validation and in a challenging database of 58 images with artifacts and stain variability. These results illustrate the feasibility of hand-designed features, in light of recent deep learning approaches, particularly in problem spaces where training examples are few.},

The amino acid composition, molecular mass, and NH2-terminal sequence of this amyloid protein are almost identical to those described for the amyloid deposited in the congophilic angiopathy of Alzheimer disease and Down syndrome, but the plaque core proteins have ragged NH2 termini. The shared 4-kDa subunit indicates a common origin for the amyloids of the plaque core and of the congophilic angiopathy. There are superficial resemblances between the solubility characteristics of the plaque core and some of the properties of scrapie infectivity, but there are no similarities in amino acid sequences between the plaque core and scrapie polypeptides.},

  abstract = {White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are brain areas of increased signal on T2-weighted or fluid-attenuated inverse recovery magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. In this study we present a new semi-automated method to measure WMH load that is based on the segmentation of the intensity histogram of fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. Thirty patients with mild cognitive impairment with variable WMH load were enrolled. The semi-automated WMH segmentation included removal of non-brain tissue, spatial normalization, removal of cerebellum and brain stem, spatial filtering, thresholding to segment probable WMH, manual editing for correction of false positives and negatives, generation of WMH map, and volumetric estimation of the WMH load. Accuracy was quantitatively evaluated by comparing semi-automated and manual WMH segmentations performed by two independent raters. Differences between the two procedures were assessed using Student's t-tests and similarity was evaluated using linear regression model and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). The volumes of the manual and semi-automated segmentations did not statistically differ (t-value = -1.79, DF = 29, p = 0.839 for rater 1; t-value = 1.113, DF = 29, p = 0.2749 for rater 2), were highly correlated [R (2) = 0.921, F (1,29) = 155.54, p {\textless} 0.0001 for rater 1; R (2) = 0.935, F (1,29) = 402.709, p {\textless} 0.0001 for rater 2] and showed a very strong spatial similarity (mean DSC = 0.78, for rater 1 and 0.77 for rater 2). In conclusion, our semi-automated method to measure the load of WMH is highly reliable and could represent a good tool that could be easily implemented in routinely neuroimaging analyses to map clinical consequences of WMH.},

The first approach can be used as a preprocessing step where the corrupted MRI image is restored by dividing it by an estimated bias field signal using a surface fitting approach. The second approach shows how to modify the fuzzy c-means algorithm so that it can be used to segment an MRI image corrupted by a bias field signal.},
