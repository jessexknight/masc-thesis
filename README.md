#### To Do
- [x] Finish motivating, introducing, and selling the VLR model
- [x] Support claim of spatial heterogeneity of lesion graylevels
- [x] Add FLAIR contrast simulation
- [x] (found methods for LPA: Schmidt thesis, Feb 2017): discuss and compare to current work
- [ ] Where to discuss how (un)important pseudo-lesion regularization is? (like paper)
- [x] Double check notation: bold, caligraphic/roman, capitals
- [x] Resolve double symbol use: J for objective & gradient (G?)
- [ ] Double check scanner notation: colours, ordering (.m vs .tex too)
- [ ] Introduce image registration / spatial standardization earlier & more gracefully
- [x] Add brainmask to appendix
- [x] Write vectorized implementation maths
- [ ] Resolve: when to introduce classic lambda regularization / implementation
